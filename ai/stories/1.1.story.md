# Story 1.1: Validate KMP Project Structure, Dependencies, and Configuration

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a Developer, I want to validate the existing KMP project structure (`https://github.com/moclam1905/SubLingo`), configure basic dependencies, and ensure correct project-wide package naming, so that I have a stable and consistently configured foundation for shared and platform-specific code.

**Context:** This is the foundational story for the entire project. It ensures the existing SubLingo repository is correctly set up as a Kotlin Multiplatform project, ready for shared and platform-specific development. It directly addresses the need for a stable starting point before any feature implementation. This story also includes the crucial step of refactoring package names, as outlined in Tech Story G.1.

## Detailed Requirements

- Clone the SubLingo repository (`https://github.com/moclam1905/SubLingo`).
- Verify the standard KMP module structure (e.g., `shared`, `composeApp`, `iosApp`) as per the Compose Multiplatform template.
- Ensure `shared` module can contain common Kotlin code.
- Ensure `composeApp` (for Android) can depend on `shared` and build a basic Android application.
- Ensure `iosApp` can depend on `shared` and build a basic iOS application.
- Set up basic KMP dependencies for networking (Ktor) and serialization (Kotlinx.serialization) in the `shared` module, as per `docs/tech-stack.md`.
- Confirm successful build and run of empty shell applications on both Android emulator/device and iOS simulator/device.
- **Refactor base package names** in `composeApp`, `iosApp` (Bundle ID), and `shared` modules from placeholders (e.g., `com.myapplication`) to `com.nguyenmoclam.sublingo` (and its sub-packages like `com.nguyenmoclam.sublingo.android`, `com.nguyenmoclam.sublingo.shared`) as per `docs/project-structure.md`.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: The project `https://github.com/moclam1905/SubLingo` is successfully cloned and opened in Android Studio / IntelliJ IDEA.
- AC2: The `shared`, `composeApp`, and `iosApp` modules are correctly configured and recognized by the IDE.
- AC3: A simple "Hello World" type function in `shared` (within `com.nguyenmoclam.sublingo.shared` package) can be called from both `composeApp` (Android) and `iosApp`.
- AC4: Both `composeApp` (Android) and `iosApp` can be built and launched successfully on their respective targets, displaying a blank screen or a placeholder view.
- AC5: Ktor and Kotlinx.serialization libraries are added as dependencies to the `shared` module and are resolvable.
- AC6: Base package names throughout the project (Kotlin/Java sources, `AndroidManifest.xml`, iOS Bundle ID) are updated to reflect `com.nguyenmoclam.sublingo` as the root.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

- **Relevant Files:**

    - Files to Create: None directly, primarily configuration and refactoring of existing files from the cloned repository.
    - Files to Modify:
        - `settings.gradle.kts` (ensure module structure)
        - `build.gradle.kts` (root, `shared`, `composeApp`, `iosApp` for package names, dependencies)
        - `shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/myapplication/*` (example, refactor to `com.nguyenmoclam.sublingo.shared.*`)
        - `composeApp/src/androidMain/kotlin/com/myapplication/*` (example, refactor to `com.nguyenmoclam.sublingo/android/*`)
        - `composeApp/src/androidMain/AndroidManifest.xml` (package name)
        - `iosApp/iosApp.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` (Bundle ID - may require Xcode GUI for changes, or careful manual edit)
        - `iosApp/iosApp/Info.plist` (Bundle ID might be reflected here or in build settings)
        - Any existing Kotlin/Swift files with old package declarations.
    - *(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md` for overall layout and target package names)*
    - *(Hint: See Tech Story G.1 from `mvp-backlog.md` for focus on package name refactoring)*

- **Key Technologies:**

    - Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)
    - Gradle (for build scripts and dependency management)
    - Android Studio / IntelliJ IDEA (for project management and refactoring)
    - Xcode (for iOS configuration, especially Bundle ID)
    - Ktor Client (dependency, e.g., `io.ktor:ktor-client-core`, `io.ktor:ktor-client-cio` or `okhttp` for Android, `darwin` for iOS)
    - Kotlinx.serialization (dependency, e.g., `org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-serialization-json`)
    - *(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list and versions)*

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**

    - Not applicable for this story beyond adding library dependencies.

- **Data Structures:**

    - Not applicable for this story.

- **Environment Variables:**

    - Not applicable for this story.
    - *(Hint: See `docs/environment-vars.md` for all variables)*

- **Coding Standards Notes:**

    - Ensure all refactored package names follow `com.nguyenmoclam.sublingo.*` structure as per `docs/project-structure.md` and `docs/coding-standards.md` (Section 2.3 Naming Conventions).
    - Use `gradle/libs.versions.toml` for managing dependency versions if not already in use in the starter project. If it's not there, this might be a good time to introduce it for Ktor and Kotlinx.serialization.
    - *(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)*

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Clone the `https://github.com/moclam1905/SubLingo` repository.
- [ ] Task 2: Open the project in Android Studio / IntelliJ IDEA and verify the KMP module structure (`shared`, `composeApp`, `iosApp`).
- [ ] Task 3: Refactor all package names (Kotlin, Android `AndroidManifest.xml`, iOS Bundle ID) from any placeholders (e.g., `com.myapplication`, `org.example.project`) to `com.nguyenmoclam.sublingo` and its sub-packages (e.g., `com.nguyenmoclam.sublingo.shared`, `com.nguyenmoclam.sublingo.android`).
    - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Refactor `shared` module package names.
    - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Refactor `composeApp` module package names and `AndroidManifest.xml`.
    - [ ] Subtask 3.3: Refactor `iosApp` Bundle ID (via Xcode project settings is safest) and any Swift package declarations if necessary.
- [ ] Task 4: Add Ktor (core, client engine for Android e.g., OkHttp, client engine for iOS e.g., Darwin) and Kotlinx.serialization (json) dependencies to the `shared/build.gradle.kts` file, ensuring they are accessible from `commonMain`.
- [ ] Task 5: Create a simple "Hello World" function (e.g., `fun greet(): String = "Hello from shared"`) in `shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/nguyenmoclam/sublingo/shared/Greeting.kt` (or similar).
- [ ] Task 6: Call the `greet()` function from `composeApp` (e.g., in `MainActivity.kt`, log output or display on a temporary Text composable).
- [ ] Task 7: Call the `greet()` function from `iosApp` (e.g., in `ContentView.swift`, print output or display on a temporary Text view).
- [ ] Task 8: Build and run the `composeApp` on an Android emulator/device. Verify it launches and the greeting works.
- [ ] Task 9: Build and run the `iosApp` on an iOS simulator/device. Verify it launches and the greeting works.
- [ ] Task 10: Ensure project builds cleanly without errors after changes.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

- **Unit Tests:**
    - Not strictly required for this setup-focused story, but the "Hello World" function in `shared` could have a simple unit test in `shared/src/commonTest/kotlin/com/nguyenmoclam/sublingo/shared/GreetingTest.kt` to verify its output.
  <!-- end list -->
  ```kotlin
  // Example GreetingTest.kt
  import kotlin.test.Test
  import kotlin.test.assertEquals

  class GreetingTest {
      @Test
      fun testGreeting() {
          assertEquals("Hello from shared", greet())
      }
  }
  ```
- **Integration Tests:** Not applicable for this story.
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    - AC1: Verified by successfully cloning and opening the project.
    - AC2: Verified by IDE recognizing module structure and successful builds.
    - AC3: Verified by successfully calling the shared function from both platforms.
    - AC4: Verified by successful launch on both platforms.
    - AC5: Verified by Gradle sync succeeding and shared code compiling with new dependencies.
    - AC6: Verified by checking file contents and build configurations for correct package names/Bundle ID.
- *(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` for the overall approach)*
