# Story 1.3: Implement Basic iOS App Shell with SwiftUI

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a Developer, I want to create a minimal iOS application shell using SwiftUI within the `iosApp` module, so that there's an entry point and basic UI structure for the iOS app.

**Context:** Following the KMP project validation (Story 1.1) and parallel to the Android shell creation (Story 1.2), this story establishes the basic iOS UI using SwiftUI. This ensures the `iosApp` module can render a simple screen and serves as the initial visual entry point for the iOS side of SubLingo.

## Detailed Requirements

- Within `iosApp/iosApp/`, set up the main app structure (`SubLingoApp.swift`).
- Implement a simple SwiftUI view (`ContentView.swift` or similar, e.g., displaying "SubLingo iOS App - MVP").
- Ensure the app targets iOS 16.0 and above, as specified in `docs/tech-stack.md`.
- Use SwiftUI for all UI elements.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: The `iosApp` launches and displays a screen with the text "SubLingo iOS App - MVP" (or similar placeholder).
- AC2: The screen is implemented using SwiftUI.
- AC3: The app's deployment target is set to iOS 16.0 in the Xcode project settings.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

- **Relevant Files:**

    - Files to Create/Modify:
        - `iosApp/iosApp/SubLingoApp.swift` (Main app entry point using `@main`)
        - `iosApp/iosApp/ContentView.swift` (Root SwiftUI view)
        - `iosApp/iosApp.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` (Deployment target setting - usually modified via Xcode GUI)
    - *(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md` for overall layout)*

- **Key Technologies:**

    - Swift
    - iOS SDK (Min deployment target iOS 16.0)
    - SwiftUI
    - Xcode (for building and setting deployment target)
    - *(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for specific versions)*

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**

    - Not applicable for this story.

- **Data Structures:**

    - Not applicable for this story.

- **Environment Variables:**

    - Not applicable for this story.

- **Coding Standards Notes:**

    - Swift struct and class names should be `PascalCase` as per `docs/coding-standards.md`.
    - Ensure file names are also `PascalCase.swift`.
    - SwiftUI views are structs.
    - *(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)*

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Open the `iosApp` project in Xcode (e.g., by opening `iosApp/iosApp.xcworkspace` or `iosApp/iosApp.xcodeproj`).
- [ ] Task 2: In Xcode, select the `iosApp` target and navigate to "General" settings. Set the "Minimum Deployments" target to iOS 16.0.
- [ ] Task 3: Ensure `iosApp/iosApp/SubLingoApp.swift` exists and is structured as the main entry point.
  ```swift
  // Example SubLingoApp.swift
  // import SwiftUI
  //
  // @main
  // struct SubLingoApp: App {
  //     var body: some Scene {
  //         WindowGroup {
  //             ContentView()
  //         }
  //     }
  // }
  ```
- [ ] Task 4: Create or update `iosApp/iosApp/ContentView.swift`.
    - [ ] Subtask 4.1: `ContentView` should be a `struct` conforming to `View`.
    - [ ] Subtask 4.2: Implement the `body` property to display a `Text` view with "SubLingo iOS App - MVP".
  <!-- end list -->
  ```swift
  // Example ContentView.swift
  // import SwiftUI
  //
  // struct ContentView: View {
  //     var body: some View {
  //         VStack {
  //             Text("SubLingo iOS App - MVP")
  //         }
  //         .padding()
  //     }
  // }
  //
  // struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
  //     static var previews: some View {
  //         ContentView()
  //     }
  // }
  ```
- [ ] Task 5: Build and run `iosApp` on an iOS simulator or device (targetting iOS 16.0+).
- [ ] Task 6: Verify AC1: The app launches and displays "SubLingo iOS App - MVP".
- [ ] Task 7: Verify AC2: The displayed text is rendered using SwiftUI.
- [ ] Task 8: Verify AC3: The deployment target is iOS 16.0 (confirm in Xcode build settings or by successful run on an iOS 16 device/simulator).

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

- **Unit Tests:**
    - Not strictly required for this very simple UI story. UI testing with SwiftUI (e.g., XCUITests) will be covered in `docs/testing-strategy.md` for more complex components later.
- **Integration Tests:** Not applicable for this story.
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    - AC1: Visually confirm the text "SubLingo iOS App - MVP" on screen after launching the app on an iOS simulator/device.
    - AC2: Confirmed by code review that SwiftUI (`Text` view) is used.
    - AC3: Confirmed by inspecting Xcode project settings.
- *(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` for the overall approach)*
