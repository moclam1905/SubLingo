# Story 1.6: Implement iOS Share Extension Stub for Images

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a Developer, I want to create a basic iOS Share Extension stub (`SubLingoShareExtension`) for images, so that the app can appear as an option when a screenshot/image is shared.

**Context:** This story sets up another key iOS integration point: the Share Extension for images. This will later be used for OCR processing of screenshots. For this initial stub, the extension will only acknowledge receipt of an image, without performing any OCR or translation. It runs parallel to the Action Extension setup (Story 1.5).

## Detailed Requirements

- Create a new Share Extension target in the `iosApp` Xcode project.
- Configure the extension to accept image input (`NSExtensionActivationRule` for image types like `public.image`).
- When invoked with an image, the extension should display a placeholder SwiftUI UI (e.g., "SubLingo Share Extension: Image Received").
- No actual OCR or translation processing is required in this story.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: The "SubLingo" Share Extension appears in the iOS Share sheet when an image (e.g., a screenshot) is shared.
- AC2: Selecting the extension launches its UI.
- AC3: The extension's UI displays a placeholder message indicating an image was received.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

- **Relevant Files:**

    - Files to Create (within the new Share Extension target, e.g., `SubLingoShareExtension`):
        - `SubLingoShareExtension/ShareViewController.swift` (or similar name provided by Xcode template, often `SLComposeServiceViewController` subclass for basic share UIs, or custom for full SwiftUI)
        - `SubLingoShareExtension/Info.plist` (configure `NSExtensionActivationRule`)
        - A SwiftUI view file for the extension's UI, e.g., `SubLingoShareExtension/ShareView.swift`
    - Files to Modify:
        - `iosApp/iosApp.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` (Xcode manages this)
    - *(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md` for proposed extension location)*

- **Key Technologies:**

    - Swift, iOS SDK
    - App Extensions (Share Extension type)
    - SwiftUI (for the extension's UI)
    - `NSExtensionContext`, `NSItemProvider` (to get shared image data)
    - `UTType.image`
    - *(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md`)*

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**

    - Reading data from `extensionContext?.inputItems`.
    - Loading image data from `NSItemProvider` (e.g., `loadItem(forTypeIdentifier: UTType.image.identifier, options: nil)`).

- **Data Structures:**

    - `UIImage` for handling the received image.

- **Environment Variables:**

    - Not applicable for this story.

- **Coding Standards Notes:**

    - Name the extension target clearly (e.g., `SubLingoShareExtension`).
    - Use SwiftUI for the extension UI.
    - *(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)*

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: In Xcode, add a new target to `iosApp`: "Share Extension". Name it `SubLingoShareExtension`. Choose SwiftUI for the UI if presented as an option, otherwise, you might need to adapt a Storyboard-based template or create a custom UIViewController hosting SwiftUI.
- [ ] Task 2: Configure `SubLingoShareExtension/Info.plist`.
    - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Set `NSExtensionActivationRule` to accept images.
      Example `Info.plist` snippet:
      ```xml
      <key>NSExtension</key>
      <dict>
          <key>NSExtensionAttributes</key>
          <dict>
              <key>NSExtensionActivationRule</key>
              <string>SUBQUERY (
                  extensionItems,
                  $extensionItem,
                  SUBQUERY (
                      $extensionItem.attachments,
                      $attachment,
                      ANY $attachment.registeredTypeIdentifiers UTI-CONFORMS-TO "public.image"
                  ).@count > 0  // Allow one or more images
              ).@count > 0</string>
          </dict>
          <key>NSExtensionPointIdentifier</key>
          <string>com.apple.share-services</string>
          </dict>
      ```
      *Alternatively, use `UTType.image.identifier` if configuring programmatically or via newer predicate syntax.*
- [ ] Task 3: Implement the UI for the Share Extension (e.g., in `ShareView.swift`).
    - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Create a simple SwiftUI view.
    - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Display a message like "SubLingo Share Extension: Image Received".
- [ ] Task 4: Implement `ShareViewController.swift` (or the principal class of the Share Extension).
    - [ ] Subtask 4.1: In `viewDidLoad()` or `isContentValid()`/`didSelectPost()`, retrieve the input item from `extensionContext`.
    - [ ] Subtask 4.2: Use `NSItemProvider` to check for image attachments. For this stub, just confirming an image item is enough. You don't need to load and display the image itself yet.
    - [ ] Subtask 4.3: Present/update the `ShareView`.
    - [ ] Subtask 4.4: Implement a way to dismiss/post the extension (e.g., a "Done" or "Cancel" button calling `extensionContext?.completeRequest(...)` or `extensionContext?.cancelRequest(...)`).
- [ ] Task 5: Test the Share Extension:
    - [ ] Subtask 5.1: Run the `SubLingoShareExtension` target on a simulator/device. Select an app to host it (e.g., Photos).
    - [ ] Subtask 5.2: In Photos, select an image, tap the Share icon, find and tap the "SubLingo" Share Extension.
    - [ ] Subtask 5.3: Verify AC1, AC2, AC3.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

- **Unit Tests:** Not applicable for this stub.
- **Integration Tests:** Not applicable for this stub.
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    - AC1: Share an image from Photos, verify "SubLingo" (or the name given to extension) appears in the Share sheet.
    - AC2: Tap the extension, verify its UI launches.
    - AC3: Verify the UI shows a message like "SubLingo Share Extension: Image Received".
- *(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` for the overall approach)*
