# Story 2.1: Prepare and Bundle "Lite" Offline Dictionary Data

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a Developer, I need to prepare a "lite" English offline dictionary (from Wiktextract processed into SQLite) and bundle it within the application, so that it can be queried by the KMP shared module.

**Context:** This story is foundational for the entire offline translation feature (Epic 2). It involves sourcing raw dictionary data, processing it into a structured SQLite format, and ensuring this database is correctly bundled with both Android and iOS applications. This directly enables the `OfflineDictionaryService` (Story 2.2) to function. This story corresponds to Tech Story S.4 (Develop Data Processing Script) and relies on the `DictionaryFileProvider` from Story 1.7 (Tech Story S.2) for access.

## Detailed Requirements

- **Data Sourcing & Processing (Corresponds to Tech Story S.4):**
    - Source English Wiktextract JSONL data.
    - Develop a script to process this data, filter for a "lite" set of common English words (target \>10,000 headwords, final count based on size/utility), and extract primary definitions and at least one usage example per definition where available.
    - The script will populate an SQLite database (e.g., `sublingo_dictionary.db`) using the schema defined in `docs/data-models.md` (WordEntity, DefinitionEntity, ExampleEntity tables).
- **Bundling:**
    - The processed SQLite dictionary file (`sublingo_dictionary.db`) must be bundled with the application in a location accessible by the KMP `shared` module on both Android (e.g., `composeApp/src/main/assets/`) and iOS (e.g., `iosApp/iosApp/Resources/`). The `DictionaryFileProvider` expect/actual (from Story 1.7 & Tech Story S.2) will provide access.
- **Size Consideration:** The final bundled dictionary should be optimized for size while maintaining utility (target \< 50MB if possible).

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: A script to process Wiktextract JSONL into the target SQLite schema is created and functional.
- AC2: The generated `sublingo_dictionary.db` file contains at least 10,000 common English headwords with definitions and examples (where available) and adheres to the schema in `docs/data-models.md`.
- AC3: The `sublingo_dictionary.db` file is included in both Android (`composeApp/src/androidMain/assets/` - note: `androidMain` not `main` for compose multiplatform asset convention, or ensure it's accessible from `commonMain/resources` which is often preferred) and iOS (`iosApp/iosApp/Resources/` or added to the Xcode project bundle).
- AC4: The KMP `shared` module, via the `DictionaryFileProvider` (expect/actual from Story 1.7, to be fully implemented in Tech Story S.2), can obtain a path or stream to access the bundled `sublingo_dictionary.db` file on both platforms. *(This AC might be fully verifiable after Tech Story S.2 is complete, but this story ensures the file is placed correctly for S.2)*
- AC5: The final size of `sublingo_dictionary.db` is documented and meets target constraints (ideally \< 50MB).

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

- **Relevant Files:**

    - Files to Create:
        - A script (e.g., `scripts/process_wiktextract.py` or similar) for processing JSONL to SQLite.
        - The output `sublingo_dictionary.db` file.
        - Place `sublingo_dictionary.db` in `shared/src/commonMain/resources/database/` (recommended KMP approach for bundling assets accessible from common code via `DictionaryFileProvider`). Alternatively, place in Android `composeApp/src/androidMain/assets/database/` and iOS `iosApp/iosApp/Resources/database/` and ensure `DictionaryFileProvider` can access these platform-specific locations. The `project-structure.md` shows `shared/src/commonMain/resources/sublingo_dictionary.db`. Let's stick to this for now.
    - Files to Modify:
        - `.gitignore` to ensure raw Wiktextract data (if large and downloaded locally) is not committed.
    - *(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md` for file locations, and `docs/data-models.md` for DB schema)*

- **Key Technologies:**

    - Scripting language (e.g., Python with `sqlite3` and `json` libraries) for data processing.
    - SQLite.
    - Android Studio / Xcode for bundling the DB file.
    - *(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` which mentions SQLite. Project Analysis recommended Wiktextract to SQLite.)*

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**

    - Not applicable for this story.

- **Data Structures:**

    - SQLite Schema: `WordEntity`, `DefinitionEntity`, `ExampleEntity` as defined in `docs/data-models.md` (Section 3).
    - Input: Wiktextract JSONL format.

- **Environment Variables:**

    - Not applicable for this story.

- **Coding Standards Notes:**

    - The processing script should be clear, maintainable, and ideally configurable (e.g., input file path, output DB path).
    - Ensure the SQLite database is generated correctly according to the schema.
    - For bundling, follow standard practices for Android assets and iOS bundle resources. The `shared/src/commonMain/resources/` path is generally preferred for KMP assets that `expect`/`actual` mechanisms will access.
    - *(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for general scripting best practices if applicable, and file naming conventions.)*

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1 (Tech Story S.4): Develop the script (`process_wiktextract.py`) to:
    - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Read Wiktextract JSONL data.
    - [ ] Subtask 1.2: Filter for English words and desired information (definitions, examples, phonetics).
    - [ ] Subtask 1.3: Implement logic for a "lite" version (e.g., selecting common words, limiting definitions/examples per word if necessary to manage size).
    - [ ] Subtask 1.4: Create an SQLite database (`sublingo_dictionary.db`) with the schema from `docs/data-models.md`.
    - [ ] Subtask 1.5: Populate the SQLite database with the processed data.
- [ ] Task 2: Run the script to generate `sublingo_dictionary.db`.
- [ ] Task 3: Verify the generated `sublingo_dictionary.db` (AC2):
    - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Check headword count (target \>10,000).
    - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Spot-check a few words to ensure definitions, examples, and schema adherence.
- [ ] Task 4: Bundle `sublingo_dictionary.db`:
    - [ ] Subtask 4.1: Place the `sublingo_dictionary.db` file into `shared/src/commonMain/resources/database/sublingo_dictionary.db` (or the agreed final location like `shared/src/commonMain/resources/sublingo_dictionary.db`). Ensure it's included in the build by Gradle configuration for resources if necessary.
    - [ ] Subtask 4.2: Verify it's correctly bundled in the Android app (e.g., check APK/AAB contents or use `DictionaryFileProvider` actual on Android once S.2 is done).
    - [ ] Subtask 4.3: Verify it's correctly bundled in the iOS app (e.g., check app bundle contents or use `DictionaryFileProvider` actual on iOS once S.2 is done).
- [ ] Task 5: Document the final size of `sublingo_dictionary.db` and confirm it meets target constraints (AC5).
- [ ] Task 6 (Partial verification of AC4): Confirm that the `DictionaryFileProvider` stubs (from Story 1.7) can theoretically access the path where the DB is placed. Full verification depends on Tech Story S.2's full implementation.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

- **Unit Tests:**
    - For the processing script: If complex, unit tests for specific parsing/filtering functions within the script would be beneficial.
- **Integration Tests:** Not directly applicable, but the output DB is integrated into the app.
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    - AC1: Run the script; verify it executes without errors and produces an SQLite file.
    - AC2: Use an SQLite browser to inspect `sublingo_dictionary.db` schema, content, and word count.
    - AC3: After building the Android and iOS apps (even empty shells), unpack the APK/AAB and iOS app bundle (`.ipa`) to confirm `sublingo_dictionary.db` is present in the expected location.
    - AC5: Check the file size of the final `sublingo_dictionary.db`.
- *(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` for the overall approach)*
