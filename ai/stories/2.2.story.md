# Story 2.2: Implement Offline Dictionary Query Service (KMP Shared)

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a Developer, I want to implement a service (`OfflineDictionaryService`) within the KMP `shared` module that can query the bundled offline SQLite dictionary using SQLDelight, so that I can retrieve definitions and examples for a given English word.

**Context:** This story is the core of the offline dictionary lookup feature. It builds upon Story 2.1 (bundled dictionary) and the `DictionaryFileProvider` (`expect`/`actual` from Story 1.7, fully implemented in Tech Story S.2). It also requires SQLDelight setup (Tech Story S.5) and Koin DI setup (Tech Story S.1). The service will provide a clean API for the UI layers to query word definitions.

## Detailed Requirements

- Create a repository/service class (e.g., `OfflineDictionaryServiceImpl`) in `commonMain` within `com.nguyenmoclam.sublingo.shared.services` or `com.nguyenmoclam.sublingo.shared.data.repository`.
- This service will receive its SQLDelight `Database` (generated from `dictionary.sq`) or specific query instances via Koin-managed dependency injection (Tech Story S.1 & S.5).
- It will use the `DictionaryFileProvider` (from Story 1.7 & Tech Story S.2) to initialize the SQLDelight driver with the bundled database.
- Implement a function (e.g., `findWord(word: String): WordDefinition?`) that takes an English word string as input.
- The function should use SQLDelight-generated type-safe Kotlin APIs to query the dictionary and return a structured `WordDefinition` object (as defined in `docs/data-models.md`) or null if not found.
- Queries should be performant.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: The `OfflineDictionaryService` can successfully initialize the SQLDelight driver with the bundled `sublingo_dictionary.db` on both Android and iOS (relies on full `DictionaryFileProvider` from Tech Story S.2).
- AC2: Given a word present in the dictionary, the service returns its `WordDefinition` (including definitions, part of speech, phonetic symbol, and examples).
- AC3: Given a word not in the dictionary, the service returns `null`.
- AC4: Basic performance test: a lookup for a common word (excluding initial DB load) completes in under 500ms on a representative device/emulator.
- AC5: SQLDelight setup (`dictionary.sq` and Gradle plugin from Tech Story S.5) is correctly configured and used by the service.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

- **Relevant Files:**

    - Files to Create:
        - `shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/nguyenmoclam/sublingo/shared/database/DriverFactory.kt` (implementing `expect fun createDriver(): SqlDriver` for SQLDelight)
        - `shared/src/androidMain/kotlin/com/nguyenmoclam/sublingo/shared/database/AndroidDriverFactory.kt` (`actual` for Android)
        - `shared/src/iosMain/kotlin/com/nguyenmoclam/sublingo/shared/database/IosDriverFactory.kt` (`actual` for iOS)
        - `shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/nguyenmoclam/sublingo/shared/data/local/dictionary.sq` (SQLDelight schema and queries - Tech Story S.5, but queries used here)
        - `shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/nguyenmoclam/sublingo/shared/domain/repository/OfflineDictionaryRepository.kt` (Interface)
        - `shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/nguyenmoclam/sublingo/shared/data/repository/OfflineDictionaryRepositoryImpl.kt` (Implementation)
        - `shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/nguyenmoclam/sublingo/shared/domain/usecase/GetWordDefinitionUseCase.kt` (Optional, good practice)
        - Koin module definitions in `shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/nguyenmoclam/sublingo/shared/di/` (Tech Story S.1)
    - Files to Modify:
        - `shared/build.gradle.kts` (for SQLDelight plugin and dependencies, if not already done by Tech Story S.5)
    - *(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md` for proposed file locations, `docs/data-models.md` for `WordDefinition` and DB schema.)*

- **Key Technologies:**

    - Kotlin, KMP
    - SQLDelight (for DB interaction and query generation)
    - SQLite (the bundled dictionary)
    - Koin (for DI)
    - Coroutines (for DB operations if they become asynchronous, though SQLDelight queries are often blocking by default and should be called from a background dispatcher)
    - `DictionaryFileProvider` (`expect`/`actual` from Story 1.7, full implementation from Tech Story S.2)
    - *(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md`)*

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**

    - SQLDelight generated Kotlin database API (e.g., `Database`, `YourQueries.selectWordDefinition()`).
    - `DictionaryFileProvider.getDictionaryPath()` (or stream access) to locate the DB for SQLDelight driver initialization.

- **Data Structures:**

    - `WordDefinition`, `DefinitionEntry` (from `docs/data-models.md`).
    - SQLDelight will generate data classes based on `dictionary.sq` queries. Need mappers if query results don't directly match `WordDefinition`. `data-models.md` shows a conceptual `selectWordDefinition` query requiring careful mapping.

- **Environment Variables:**

    - Not applicable for this story.

- **Coding Standards Notes:**

    - Structure according to Clean Architecture principles: `OfflineDictionaryRepository` in `domain`, `OfflineDictionaryRepositoryImpl` in `data`.
    - Use Koin for injecting `Database` (SQLDelight) instance or query objects.
    - Ensure database operations are performed off the main thread (e.g., using `withContext(Dispatchers.IO)` if called from a coroutine scope).
    - Handle potential exceptions during DB initialization or querying, map to domain errors if using a `Result` type.
    - *(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md`)*

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1 (Tech Story S.5 if not done): Ensure SQLDelight is configured in `shared/build.gradle.kts` and `dictionary.sq` with the schema from `docs/data-models.md` is present. Generate SQLDelight adapters.
- [ ] Task 2 (Tech Story S.2 if not done): Fully implement `DictionaryFileProvider` (`expect`/`actual`) to correctly provide access to the bundled `sublingo_dictionary.db` on Android and iOS. This is critical for SQLDelight driver setup.
- [ ] Task 3: Implement `DriverFactory.kt` (`expect`/`actual`) for creating SQLDelight `SqlDriver`.
    - `actual fun createDriver()` in `androidMain` will use `AndroidSqliteDriver` and `DictionaryFileProvider`.
    - `actual fun createDriver()` in `iosMain` will use `NativeSqliteDriver` and `DictionaryFileProvider`.
- [ ] Task 4: Define `OfflineDictionaryRepository` interface in `shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/.../domain/repository/`.
  ```kotlin
  // package com.nguyenmoclam.sublingo.shared.domain.repository
  // import com.nguyenmoclam.sublingo.shared.domain.model.WordDefinition
  //
  // interface OfflineDictionaryRepository {
  //     suspend fun findWord(word: String): WordDefinition?
  // }
  ```
- [ ] Task 5: Implement `OfflineDictionaryRepositoryImpl.kt` in `shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/.../data/repository/`.
    - [ ] Subtask 5.1: Constructor takes `SubLingoDB` (the SQLDelight generated Database class) as a dependency.
    - [ ] Subtask 5.2: Implement `findWord(word: String)`:
        - Use SQLDelight queries (e.g., `database.wordEntityQueries.selectWordByName(word)` then fetch related definitions and examples).
        - Map the query results to the `WordDefinition` domain model. This might involve multiple queries or a complex join and mapper as suggested in `docs/data-models.md`.
        - Ensure this operation is executed on a background thread (e.g., `withContext(Dispatchers.IO)`).
- [ ] Task 6 (Tech Story S.1 if not done): Set up Koin modules in `shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/.../di/` to provide:
    - `SqlDriver` (using `DriverFactory`)
    - `SubLingoDB` (SQLDelight Database instance)
    - `OfflineDictionaryRepository` (binding `OfflineDictionaryRepositoryImpl`)
- [ ] Task 7: (Optional but good practice) Create `GetWordDefinitionUseCase.kt` in `domain/usecase` that depends on `OfflineDictionaryRepository`.
- [ ] Task 8: Test AC1: Initialize the repository/service (via Koin if possible in a test setup) and confirm no crashes during DB driver initialization on both platforms (may need platform-specific tests or careful common test setup).
- [ ] Task 9: Write unit tests for `OfflineDictionaryRepositoryImpl` (or UseCase):
    - Mock the SQLDelight `Database` or its generated query interfaces.
    - Test returning a `WordDefinition` for a known word (AC2).
    - Test returning `null` for an unknown word (AC3).
- [ ] Task 10: Perform a basic manual performance test (AC4) once integrated into a testable app environment or via a dedicated test.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

- **Unit Tests:**
    - Test `OfflineDictionaryRepositoryImpl` (or `GetWordDefinitionUseCase`).
    - Use SQLDelight's in-memory JDBC driver (`JdbcSqliteDriver(JdbcSqliteDriver.IN_MEMORY)`) for `commonTest` if feasible, or mock the generated `*Queries` interfaces.
    - Verify correct mapping from SQLDelight results to `WordDefinition`.
    - Test scenarios: word found, word not found, words with/without examples/phonetics.
- **Integration Tests:**
    - Test the service with a real (test version of) `sublingo_dictionary.db` if possible in a test environment for KMP.
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    - AC1: Primarily verified through successful execution of other ACs that rely on DB initialization.
    - AC4: Requires calling `findWord` from either a test app or a performance test suite and measuring execution time. This might be deferred to UI integration stories (2.3, 2.4) for practical measurement.
    - AC5: Verified by successful compilation and usage of SQLDelight-generated code.
- *(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` for overall testing approach and KMP unit test tools.)*
