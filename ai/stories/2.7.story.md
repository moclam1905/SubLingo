# Story 2.7: Implement Basic Cache for Offline Lookups (KMP Shared)

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a Developer, I want to implement a simple in-memory cache (`TranslationCache.kt`) for the last N (e.g., 20) offline word lookups in the KMP `shared` module, so that repeated queries for the same words are faster and reduce processing.

**Context:** This story introduces a performance optimization for the offline dictionary feature. By caching recent `WordDefinition` results in memory, subsequent lookups for the same words can bypass the SQLite query, improving responsiveness. This cache will be used by the `OfflineDictionaryService` (or its repository implementation).

## Detailed Requirements

- Modify the `OfflineDictionaryService` (or its implementation/repository) to use a caching wrapper or integrate caching logic directly. The cache itself can be a separate class (`TranslationCache`) injected via Koin.
- Implement an in-memory LRU cache (e.g., using a `LinkedHashMap`) to store `WordDefinition` results for the last 20 unique words looked up.
- Before querying the dictionary via SQLDelight, check the cache. If the word is found in the cache, return the cached result.
- If not in cache, query the dictionary and store the `WordDefinition` result in the cache before returning.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: The KMP `OfflineDictionaryService` (or its underlying repository) uses an in-memory cache for `WordDefinition` objects.
- AC2: Looking up a word for the second time (if within the last 20 unique lookups and cache hasn't been cleared) retrieves the result from the cache instead of re-querying the SQLite database.
- AC3: The cache correctly evicts the oldest entries when its capacity (20 words) is exceeded.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

- **Relevant Files:**

    - Files to Create:
        - `shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/nguyenmoclam/sublingo/shared/cache/TranslationCache.kt` (Implementation of the LRU cache)
    - Files to Modify:
        - `shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/nguyenmoclam/sublingo/shared/data/repository/OfflineDictionaryRepositoryImpl.kt` (To integrate and use `TranslationCache`)
        - Koin modules in `shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/.../di/` (To provide `TranslationCache` as a singleton)
    - *(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md` for file locations. `docs/data-models.md` Section 4 mentions TranslationCache.)*

- **Key Technologies:**

    - Kotlin, KMP
    - `LinkedHashMap` (for LRU cache implementation if done manually) or a KMP-compatible cache library if one exists and is simple enough (but `LinkedHashMap` is fine for MVP).
    - Koin (for DI).
    - *(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md`)*

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**

    - Not applicable.

- **Data Structures:**

    - `WordDefinition`.
    - `LinkedHashMap<String, WordDefinition>` for the cache (String key is the word).

- **Environment Variables:**

    - Not applicable.

- **Coding Standards Notes:**

    - `TranslationCache` should be thread-safe if accessed from multiple coroutines/threads, though for KMP client-side usage with `OfflineDictionaryRepositoryImpl` calls typically managed by ViewModels, explicit locking might be avoidable if a single `Dispatchers.IO` context is used for all repository access. For simplicity, a basic `LinkedHashMap` without external locking is okay for MVP if access is properly managed.
    - Cache size (20 entries) should be a configurable constant.
    - *(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md`)*

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Implement `TranslationCache.kt`.
    - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Define a class `TranslationCache` with a configurable capacity (default 20 for words).
    - [ ] Subtask 1.2: Use a `LinkedHashMap` to store `word (String)` to `WordDefinition`.
    - [ ] Subtask 1.3: Implement `get(key: String): WordDefinition?`. If `accessOrder` of `LinkedHashMap` is true, getting an item makes it recently used.
    - [ ] Subtask 1.4: Implement `put(key: String, value: WordDefinition)`. Ensure LRU eviction if capacity is exceeded (override `removeEldestEntry` if using Java's LinkedHashMap directly, or manage manually).
    - [ ] Subtask 1.5: Implement `clear()` method.
- [ ] Task 2: Update Koin modules to provide `TranslationCache` as a singleton instance (for word definitions).
- [ ] Task 3: Modify `OfflineDictionaryRepositoryImpl.kt`.
    - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Inject `TranslationCache` (for `WordDefinition`).
    - [ ] Subtask 3.2: In `findWord(word: String)`:
        - First, try to get the `WordDefinition` from `translationCache.get(word)`.
        - If found, return it.
        - If not found, query the SQLite database (as before).
        - If the database query returns a result, put it into `translationCache.put(word, result)` before returning.
- [ ] Task 4: Write unit tests for `TranslationCache.kt`.
    - [ ] Subtask 4.1: Test `put` and `get`.
    - [ ] Subtask 4.2: Test LRU eviction logic (AC3).
    - [ ] Subtask 4.3: Test `clear` method.
- [ ] Task 5: Update unit tests for `OfflineDictionaryRepositoryImpl`.
    - [ ] Subtask 5.1: Mock `TranslationCache`.
    - [ ] Subtask 5.2: Verify cache is checked first (e.g., `cache.get` is called).
    - [ ] Subtask 5.3: Verify DB is called if cache misses.
    - [ ] Subtask 5.4: Verify result is put into cache after DB lookup (AC1).
- [ ] Task 6: Test AC2 manually or by adding specific integration/E2E test logging:
    - Lookup a word, then look it up again immediately. Verify from logs or debugger that the second lookup hits the cache.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

- **Unit Tests:**
    - Thoroughly test `TranslationCache` logic (put, get, eviction, clear).
    - Test `OfflineDictionaryRepositoryImpl` to ensure it interacts correctly with the cache (checks cache first, populates cache on miss).
- **Integration Tests:** Not primary for MVP.
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    - AC1 & AC2: Requires instrumentation or debugging. After looking up a word, look it up again. Step through `OfflineDictionaryRepositoryImpl.findWord` to see if the DB query is skipped and data is returned from cache.
    - AC3: Can be primarily verified via unit tests for `TranslationCache`.
- *(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md`)*
