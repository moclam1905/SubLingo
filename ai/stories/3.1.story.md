# Story 3.1: Android Screenshot Capture and Basic Cropping Logic

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a Developer, when the user taps the floating bubble on Android, I need to capture the current screen and apply basic cropping logic to isolate the potential comment area, so that a relevant image section is available for OCR.

**Context:** This story is the first step in the OCR pipeline for Android. It extends the `FloatingBubbleService` (from Story 1.4) to capture the screen content when the bubble is interacted with. Basic cropping is introduced to narrow down the image area for more efficient and accurate OCR processing by `MlKitOcrProvider` (Story 3.2). More advanced cropping is noted as Tech Story A.2.

## Detailed Requirements

- On bubble tap (interaction defined in Epic 1, `FloatingBubbleService.kt`), capture a screenshot of the current screen content using appropriate Android screen capture APIs.
- Implement a basic heuristic to crop the screenshot. This might involve:
    - Capturing a predefined region around the bubble's tap location.
    - A simple attempt to identify a rectangular area likely to contain a comment. (Advanced cropping in **Tech Story A.2**)
- The primary goal is to reduce the image size sent to OCR and focus on the area of interest.
- This story does *not* include the OCR processing itself, only image capture and initial cropping. The cropped image (Bitmap) will be passed to the `MlKitOcrProvider`.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: Tapping the Android floating bubble successfully captures a screenshot.
- AC2: A cropped portion of the screenshot is available as an Android `Bitmap` object.
- AC3: The cropping logic uses the tap location or a simple predefined region as a basis.
- AC4: The captured/cropped image is ready to be passed to the `MlKitOcrProvider`.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

- **Relevant Files:**

    - Files to Modify:
        - `composeApp/src/androidMain/kotlin/com/nguyenmoclam/sublingo/android/service/FloatingBubbleService.kt`
    - *(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md` for file locations.)*

- **Key Technologies:**

    - Kotlin, Android SDK
    - Android screen capture APIs (e.g., `MediaProjection` for API 21+, or drawing the root view to a `Bitmap` for simpler cases if applicable to overlays, though `MediaProjection` is more robust for capturing other apps' content). For overlay content itself, the service's own drawing cache might be an option, but for "screen content," `MediaProjection` is standard. *Developer Note: `MediaProjection` requires user permission. This permission flow should be integrated here or as part of bubble activation.*
    - Android `Bitmap` manipulation (`Bitmap.createBitmap` for cropping).
    - *(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md`)*

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**

    - If using `MediaProjection`: `MediaProjectionManager`, `createScreenCaptureIntent()`, `onActivityResult` to get `MediaProjection` instance.
    - `ImageReader` to get image data from `VirtualDisplay`.
    - `BitmapFactory` to convert image bytes to `Bitmap`.
    - `Bitmap.createBitmap(source, x, y, width, height)` for cropping.

- **Data Structures:**

    - `android.graphics.Bitmap`

- **Environment Variables:**

    - Not applicable for this story.

- **Coding Standards Notes:**

    - Ensure screenshot capture is efficient and doesn't block the UI thread. Use coroutines or background threads.
    - Handle required permissions (e.g., `MediaProjection` requires user consent). If not handled in Story 1.4, it must be added here. The "Draw Over Other Apps" permission is separate.
    - Cropping logic should be clearly defined, even if basic.
    - *(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md`)*

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Determine and implement the screen capture mechanism in `FloatingBubbleService.kt`.
    - [ ] Subtask 1.1: If `MediaProjection` API is chosen:
        - Request `MediaProjection` permission from the user when the bubble is first activated or this feature is triggered. This often involves starting an Activity from the Service.
        - Handle the permission result.
        - Implement logic to capture the screen to a `Bitmap` using `MediaProjection`, `VirtualDisplay`, and `ImageReader`.
    - [ ] Subtask 1.2: If a simpler view-based capture is viable (less likely for capturing *other apps'* content), implement that.
- [ ] Task 2: Implement basic cropping logic in `FloatingBubbleService.kt`.
    - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Define a heuristic (e.g., a fixed-size rectangle around the bubble's last known tap coordinates, or a predefined portion of the screen).
    - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Use `Bitmap.createBitmap()` to crop the captured screenshot.
- [ ] Task 3: Ensure the cropped `Bitmap` is available to be passed to a subsequent OCR processing step (e.g., as a return value or by calling the next component).
- [ ] Task 4: Test screenshot capture on bubble tap (AC1).
- [ ] Task 5: Verify a `Bitmap` object representing a cropped portion of the screen is generated (AC2). Debug or save the bitmap to verify.
- [ ] Task 6: Confirm the cropping logic uses a basic heuristic as planned (AC3).
- [ ] Task 7: Ensure the system is ready for the `MlKitOcrProvider` to receive this bitmap (AC4).

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

- **Unit Tests:** Difficult for screenshot capture logic. Focus on manual E2E.
- **Integration Tests:** Not for this story in MVP.
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    - AC1: Tap the bubble; use logging or debugger to confirm screenshot capture is triggered and completes.
    - AC2: Save the cropped bitmap to device storage temporarily during testing and visually inspect it to confirm it's a valid, cropped image.
    - AC3: Review code and test with bubble taps at different screen locations to see how the crop area changes.
    - AC4: Ensure the `Bitmap` object is correctly formed and ready.
    - Verify permission handling for `MediaProjection` if implemented.
- *(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md`)*
