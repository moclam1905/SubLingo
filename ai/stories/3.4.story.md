# Story 3.4: Implement Image Receiving in iOS Share Extension

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a Developer, I need the iOS Share Extension (`SubLingoShareExtension`) to correctly receive and handle an image (screenshot) shared by the user.

**Context:** This story parallels Story 3.1 (Android screenshot capture) by setting up the image input mechanism for OCR on iOS. It ensures the `SubLingoShareExtension` (created as a stub in Story 1.6) can properly receive an image shared from another app (e.g., Photos app after taking a screenshot). This image will then be passed to the `VisionOcrProvider` in Story 3.5.

## Detailed Requirements

- Ensure the `SubLingoShareExtension` is configured to accept image types (e.g., PNG, JPEG via its `Info.plist` and `NSExtensionActivationRule`).
- When an image is shared to the extension, it should be accessible as a `UIImage` object within the extension's `ShareViewController.swift`.
- Handle potential errors in receiving or loading the image. The image will be passed to the `VisionOcrProvider`.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: The `SubLingoShareExtension` can be invoked by sharing a screenshot.
- AC2: The shared image is successfully loaded and available as a `UIImage` within the extension.
- AC3: If no image or an invalid item is shared, the extension handles it gracefully (e.g., shows an error or dismisses).

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

- **Relevant Files:**

    - Files to Modify:
        - `iosApp/SubLingoShareExtension/ShareViewController.swift` (or the principal class of the Share Extension)
        - `iosApp/SubLingoShareExtension/Info.plist` (to ensure activation rule is correct for images)
    - *(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md` and Story 1.6 for initial Share Extension setup.)*

- **Key Technologies:**

    - Swift, iOS SDK, App Extension (Share)
    - `NSExtensionContext`, `NSItemProvider`
    - `UTType.image` (for identifying image types)
    - `UIImage`
    - *(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md`)*

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**

    - `extensionContext?.inputItems` to get an array of `NSExtensionItem`.
    - Iterate through `attachments` of `NSExtensionItem`.
    - `itemProvider.hasItemConformingToTypeIdentifier(UTType.image.identifier)`.
    - `itemProvider.loadItem(forTypeIdentifier: UTType.image.identifier, options: nil)` to get image data, then convert to `UIImage`. Alternatively, `itemProvider.loadObject(ofClass: UIImage.self)`.

- **Data Structures:**

    - `UIImage`

- **Environment Variables:**

    - Not applicable.

- **Coding Standards Notes:**

    - Error handling for item provider loading is important.
    - Ensure processing happens efficiently within extension limits.
    - *(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md`)*

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Verify/update `SubLingoShareExtension/Info.plist` to ensure `NSExtensionActivationRule` is correctly configured for `public.image` (or specific image UTTypes).
- [ ] Task 2: In `ShareViewController.swift` (or equivalent principal class for the Share Extension):
    - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Access `extensionContext?.inputItems`.
    - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Iterate through input items and their attachments (`NSItemProvider`).
    - [ ] Subtask 2.3: Check if an attachment conforms to `UTType.image`.
    - [ ] Subtask 2.4: If an image item provider is found, use `loadObject(ofClass: UIImage.self)` or `loadItem(forTypeIdentifier:)` to load it as a `UIImage`.
    - [ ] Subtask 2.5: Store the loaded `UIImage` (e.g., in a property or pass to another method).
    - [ ] Subtask 2.6: Handle cases where no image is found or loading fails (AC3) â€“ e.g., update UI to show an error, or call `extensionContext?.cancelRequest(...)`.
- [ ] Task 3: For this story, after successfully loading the `UIImage`, you can update the placeholder UI from Story 1.6 to confirm "UIImage loaded successfully" or display its size.
- [ ] Task 4: Test by sharing a screenshot from the Photos app to the `SubLingoShareExtension` (AC1).
- [ ] Task 5: Verify the `UIImage` is loaded correctly in the extension (e.g., by logging its size or properties, or temporarily displaying it if UI allows) (AC2).
- [ ] Task 6: Test by sharing a non-image item (e.g., text) to the Share Extension. Verify it handles this gracefully (AC3), ideally by not attempting to process it as an image or showing an appropriate message.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

- **Unit Tests:** Not typical for this part of an extension.
- **Integration Tests:** Not for MVP.
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    - AC1: Share a screenshot; confirm SubLingo Share Extension is an option and can be selected.
    - AC2: Use debugger or logging in `ShareViewController` to confirm `UIImage` object is non-nil and has valid properties (e.g., size).
    - AC3: Share an item that is not an image (e.g., a text file if possible via share sheet, or a URL). Verify the extension doesn't crash and either dismisses, shows an error, or ignores it.
- *(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md`)*
