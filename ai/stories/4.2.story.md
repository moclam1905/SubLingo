# Story 4.2: Integrate Online Sentence Translation in Android UI

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a User, when I select a sentence or use OCR on a comment containing a sentence on Android, I want the option to translate it using the online service and see the result in the SubLingo UI.

**Context:** This story connects the `OnlineTranslationService` (Story 4.1) to the Android UI. When the KMP shared logic determines that online translation is appropriate (e.g., for multi-word OCR results or selected phrases), this story ensures the Android `FloatingBubbleService` (via its ViewModel) calls the service and displays the translation. It also introduces UI cues for online activity and loading states.

## Detailed Requirements

- The KMP `shared` module's domain logic (e.g., a use case called by `FloatingBubbleService`'s ViewModel) will determine when to invoke online translation (e.g., if selected/OCR'd text is more than N words, or if offline lookup yields no result for the whole phrase).
- If online translation is invoked by KMP core:
    - The Android UI (`FloatingBubbleService` or its Compose UI) should clearly indicate that an online service is being used (e.g., small icon, text).
    - Show a loading indicator during the API call.
    - The KMP `OnlineTranslationService` (via repository/use case) is called by the shared domain logic, orchestrated by the Android ViewModel.
    - Display the translated sentence from `TranslationResult` in the Android floating bubble or designated UI.
    - This feature's availability depends on the "Enable Online Translation" setting (Epic 5). For this story, assume it's enabled.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: The Android UI triggers KMP shared logic which then calls the KMP `OnlineTranslationService` (via repository/use case) for multi-word text segments.
- AC2: A visual cue indicates that an online translation is being performed.
- AC3: A loading indicator is displayed during the online translation process.
- AC4: The translated sentence is displayed in the Android UI.
- AC5: If the online translation fails (basic error from Story 4.1 reported by KMP core), an appropriate message is shown.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

- **Relevant Files:**

    - Files to Modify:
        - `composeApp/src/androidMain/kotlin/com/nguyenmoclam/sublingo/android/ui/bubble/BubbleViewModel.kt` (To call `OnlineTranslationRepository` / `TranslateSentenceUseCase` and manage state)
        - `composeApp/src/androidMain/kotlin/com/nguyenmoclam/sublingo/android/ui/bubble/BubbleContent.kt` (To display online translation, loading, and error states)
        - `shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/nguyenmoclam/sublingo/shared/domain/usecase/ProcessExtractedTextUseCase.kt` (or similar logic in `BubbleViewModel` if no dedicated use case, to decide when to go online).
    - *(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md`.)*

- **Key Technologies:**

    - Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Android ViewModel
    - Koin (for KMP `OnlineTranslationRepository` / `TranslateSentenceUseCase` in ViewModel)
    - Coroutines
    - Material 3 Components (`CircularProgressIndicator`, `Text`, `Icon`)
    - *(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md`)*

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**

    - `BubbleViewModel` will call KMP `onlineTranslationRepository.translateSentence(...)` or equivalent use case.

- **Data Structures:**

    - Input: `String` (text to translate).
    - Output: `TranslationResult` (from KMP service).
    - `BubbleUiState` in ViewModel needs to be enhanced to reflect online translation state (loading, result, specific error messages for online failures).

- **Environment Variables:**

    - Not applicable directly, but `OnlineTranslationService` uses the API key.

- **Coding Standards Notes:**

    - ViewModel should clearly differentiate states for offline vs. online lookup results.
    - UI should provide unambiguous feedback for online operations.
    - The logic to decide *when* to use online translation (e.g., text length \> X words, or after offline attempt fails for multi-word input) should be implemented in the KMP shared use case or Android ViewModel.
    - *(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md`. Online translation indication is important as per Story 4.4.)*

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Enhance `BubbleViewModel.kt`.
    - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Inject `OnlineTranslationRepository` or `TranslateSentenceUseCase`.
    - [ ] Subtask 1.2: Update `BubbleUiState` to include properties for online translation loading, result (`TranslationResult`), and specific error messages.
    - [ ] Subtask 1.3: Modify/Create a function (e.g., `processTextForTranslation(text: String)`) that:
        - Decides if online translation should be used (e.g., based on text length, or if it's OCR'd multi-word text).
        - If online: Set loading state, call the KMP online translation service, update UI state with `TranslationResult` or error.
        - If offline (for single words, covered in Epic 2): Call offline service.
- [ ] Task 2: Modify `BubbleContent.kt` UI.
    - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Display a loading indicator (e.g., `CircularProgressIndicator`) when online translation is in progress. (AC3)
    - [ ] Subtask 2.2: When displaying `TranslationResult` from an online source:
        - Show the `translatedText`.
        - Include a small visual cue (e.g., a cloud icon or text like "Online") next to the translation. (AC2)
    - [ ] Subtask 2.3: If online translation fails, display a user-friendly error message based on the error from KMP service (e.g., "Online translation failed. Check connection."). (AC5)
- [ ] Task 3: Test integration:
    - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Trigger translation for a sentence (e.g., via OCR result or manual input if test interface allows). Verify KMP `OnlineTranslationService` is called. (AC1)
    - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Verify loading indicator and visual cue for online translation. (AC2, AC3)
    - [ ] Subtask 3.3: Verify translated sentence is displayed. (AC4)
    - [ ] Subtask 3.4: Simulate an online translation error (e.g., by providing an invalid API key temporarily for testing, or using MockEngine if testing ViewModel with mocked service) and verify error message. (AC5)

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

- **Unit Tests:**
    - Test `BubbleViewModel` logic for deciding when to use online translation and for handling results/errors from the mocked `OnlineTranslationRepository`/`TranslateSentenceUseCase`.
- **Integration Tests:** Not for MVP.
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    - AC1: Use debugger/logging to confirm KMP online service call.
    - AC2: Visually check for the "online" indicator.
    - AC3: Visually check for the loading spinner.
    - AC4: Provide a sentence and verify correct Vietnamese translation appears in the bubble.
    - AC5: Test with no internet connection or (if possible and safe) temporarily use an invalid API key to see error message.
- *(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md`)*
