# Story 4.3: Integrate Online Sentence Translation in iOS Extensions

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a User, when I select a sentence or share a screenshot containing a sentence to the iOS SubLingo extensions, I want the option to translate it using the online service and see the result.

**Context:** This story mirrors Story 4.2 for the iOS platform. It integrates the KMP `OnlineTranslationService` (Story 4.1) with the iOS Action and Share Extensions. When text (either selected or OCR'd from an image) is suitable for online translation, the extensions (via their ViewModel) will call the KMP service and display the result in their SwiftUI UI.

## Detailed Requirements

- Similar logic as Android: KMP `shared` module's domain logic (called by `ActionExtension` or `ShareExtension`'s ViewModel) determines when to invoke online translation.
- If online translation is invoked by KMP core:
    - The iOS extension UI (SwiftUI) should clearly indicate that an online service is being used.
    - Show a loading indicator during the API call.
    - The KMP `OnlineTranslationService` (via repository/use case) is called by the shared domain logic, orchestrated by the iOS ViewModel.
    - Display the translated sentence from `TranslationResult` in the iOS Action/Share Extension UI.
    - This feature's availability depends on the "Enable Online Translation" setting (Epic 5). For this story, assume it's enabled.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: The iOS Action/Share Extensions trigger KMP shared logic which then calls the KMP `OnlineTranslationService` (via repository/use case) for multi-word text segments.
- AC2: A visual cue in the extension UI indicates that an online translation is being performed.
- AC3: A loading indicator is displayed during the online translation process in the extension.
- AC4: The translated sentence is displayed in the extension UI.
- AC5: If the online translation fails (basic error from Story 4.1 reported by KMP core), an appropriate message is shown.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

- **Relevant Files:**

    - Files to Modify:
        - `iosApp/SubLingoActionExtension/ActionViewModel.swift` (or `ShareViewModel.swift`)
        - `iosApp/SubLingoActionExtension/ActionView.swift` (or `ShareView.swift`)
        - Potentially a shared KMP use case if logic for when to go online is complex.
    - *(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md`.)*

- **Key Technologies:**

    - Swift, SwiftUI, iOS App Extensions
    - Koin (for KMP services in ViewModel)
    - Combine or Swift Concurrency (`async/await`)
    - *(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md`)*

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**

    - ViewModel calls KMP `onlineTranslationRepository.translateSentence(...)`.

- **Data Structures:**

    - Input: `String`. Output: `TranslationResult`.
    - ViewModel's UI state needs to reflect online translation progress.

- **Environment Variables:**

    - Not applicable directly.

- **Coding Standards Notes:**

    - ViewModel (`ObservableObject`) manages state for SwiftUI.
    - Clear UI indication of online activity.
    - *(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` and Story 4.4.)*

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Enhance iOS Extension ViewModel (`ActionViewModel.swift` or `ShareViewModel.swift`).
    - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Inject KMP `OnlineTranslationRepository` or `TranslateSentenceUseCase`.
    - [ ] Subtask 1.2: Update UI state properties for online translation (loading, result, error).
    - [ ] Subtask 1.3: Modify/Create `processTextForTranslation(text: String)` function.
        - Decide if online translation is needed.
        - If online: Set loading, call KMP service (using `async/await`), update UI state.
- [ ] Task 2: Update iOS Extension SwiftUI View (`ActionView.swift` or `ShareView.swift`).
    - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Display `ProgressView` when loading. (AC3)
    - [ ] Subtask 2.2: When displaying online `TranslationResult`:
        - Show `translatedText`.
        - Include visual cue (e.g., `Image(systemName: "cloud.fill")` or text). (AC2)
    - [ ] Subtask 2.3: If online translation fails, show error message. (AC5)
- [ ] Task 3: Test integration:
    - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Share a sentence to Action Extension or an image with a sentence to Share Extension. Verify KMP online service is called. (AC1)
    - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Verify loading/online indicators. (AC2, AC3)
    - [ ] Subtask 3.3: Verify translated sentence. (AC4)
    - [ ] Subtask 3.4: Simulate error and verify message. (AC5)

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

- **Unit Tests:**
    - Test iOS ViewModel logic for online translation decision and state updates, mocking KMP service.
- **Integration Tests:** Not for MVP.
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    - AC1: Debugger/logging.
    - AC2: Visual check for "online" indicator in extension UI.
    - AC3: Visual check for loading indicator.
    - AC4: Verify translation.
    - AC5: Test with no internet or simulated API error.
- *(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md`)*
