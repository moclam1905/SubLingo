# Story 4.4: User Indication and Expectation Management for Online Translation

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a User, I want to be clearly informed when an online translation is occurring and understand potential implications (speed, data use, privacy), so I can make an informed choice.

**Context:** This story focuses on UX transparency for online features. It ensures that users are always aware when SubLingo is using an external, online service for translation. This involves implementing consistent visual cues across both Android and iOS platforms. Privacy notes are primarily handled in Epic 5/6, but UI cues are established here.

## Detailed Requirements

- **Visual Cues:** Implement consistent visual indicators (e.g., a small cloud icon or text like "Online translation") whenever an online translation is displayed on both Android (bubble) and iOS (extensions).
- **Performance Expectation:**
    - Loading indicators (from Story 4.2, 4.3) manage this during the call. Target API latency is â‰¤ 2s.
- **Privacy Note (Onboarding/Settings):** Information regarding text being sent to a third-party API should be part of the privacy policy and potentially highlighted during onboarding or in settings where online translation is toggled (Epic 5). This story focuses on the in-translation UI cues.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: A clear visual indicator (icon or text) is present alongside translations performed by the online service on both platforms (Android bubble, iOS extensions).
- AC2: The indicator clearly identifies the nature (online) of the translation.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

- **Relevant Files:**

    - Files to Modify:
        - `composeApp/src/androidMain/kotlin/com/nguyenmoclam/sublingo/android/ui/bubble/BubbleContent.kt` (Where online translation result is displayed)
        - `iosApp/SubLingoActionExtension/ActionView.swift` (or `ShareView.swift`) (Where online translation result is displayed)
    - *(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md`.)*

- **Key Technologies:**

    - Jetpack Compose (Android: `Icon`, `Text` composables)
    - SwiftUI (iOS: `Image`, `Text` views)
    - Material Icons (Android), SF Symbols (iOS) for icons.
    - *(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md`)*

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**

    - Not applicable.

- **Data Structures:**

    - The `TranslationResult` domain model has an `isOnlineTranslation: Boolean` flag (defined in `docs/data-models.md`). This flag should be set by `OnlineTranslationRepositoryImpl` and checked by the UI to conditionally display the indicator.

- **Environment Variables:**

    - Not applicable.

- **Coding Standards Notes:**

    - The visual indicator should be noticeable but not overly intrusive.
    - Consistency in icon/text usage across platforms is desirable.
    - Ensure the `isOnlineTranslation` flag in `TranslationResult` is correctly populated by the `OnlineTranslationRepositoryImpl` and propagated to the UI state.
    - *(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md`)*

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Ensure `OnlineTranslationRepositoryImpl` correctly sets `isOnlineTranslation = true` in the `TranslationResult` it returns. Also, ensure `OfflineDictionaryRepositoryImpl` sets `isOnlineTranslation = false` (or it defaults to false).
- [ ] Task 2: Modify `BubbleContent.kt` (Android).
    - [ ] Subtask 2.1: When displaying a `TranslationResult`, check its `isOnlineTranslation` flag (via ViewModel state).
    - [ ] Subtask 2.2: If true, display a small cloud icon (e.g., `Icons.Filled.Cloud`) or a text label "Online" next to or below the translated text.
- [ ] Task 3: Modify `ActionView.swift` / `ShareView.swift` (iOS).
    - [ ] Subtask 3.1: When displaying a `TranslationResult`, check its `isOnlineTranslation` flag (via ViewModel state).
    - [ ] Subtask 3.2: If true, display a small cloud icon (e.g., `Image(systemName: "cloud.fill")`) or a text label "Online" next to or below the translated text.
- [ ] Task 4: Test on Android: Perform an online translation and verify the indicator appears (AC1, AC2).
- [ ] Task 5: Test on iOS: Perform an online translation via an extension and verify the indicator appears (AC1, AC2).
- [ ] Task 6: Perform an offline word lookup (from Epic 2) and verify the "online" indicator *does not* appear.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

- **Unit Tests:**
    - Not directly for the UI indicator itself, but ViewModel tests should confirm that the `isOnlineTranslation` flag is correctly passed to the UI state.
- **Integration Tests:** Not for MVP.
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    - AC1 & AC2: Visually inspect the Android bubble and iOS extension UIs after an online translation to confirm the presence and clarity of the "online" indicator. Compare with an offline translation to ensure the indicator is conditional.
- *(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md`)*
