# Story 4.6: Implement Basic Cache for Online Sentence Translations (KMP Shared)

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a Developer, I want to implement a simple in-memory cache (`TranslationCache.kt`) for the last N (e.g., 20) online sentence translations in the KMP `shared` module, so that repeated requests for the same sentences are faster and reduce API calls/costs.

**Context:** This story introduces a performance and cost-saving optimization for online translations. Similar to Story 2.7 for offline lookups, this implements an in-memory LRU cache for `TranslationResult` objects obtained from the `OnlineTranslationService`. This reduces redundant API calls if the same sentence is translated multiple times.

## Detailed Requirements

- Modify the `OnlineTranslationService` (or its implementation/repository, likely `OnlineTranslationRepositoryImpl.kt`) to use the `TranslationCache` (injected via Koin).
- The cache will store `TranslationResult` objects.
- The cache key should be the source sentence text (and potentially target language if it becomes configurable, but for MVP English source to Vietnamese target is fixed).
- Before making an API call, check the cache. If the sentence is found, return the cached translation.
- If not in cache, make the API call, and store the `TranslationResult` in the cache before returning.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: The KMP `OnlineTranslationService` (or its repository) uses the `TranslationCache` for sentence translations.
- AC2: Translating a sentence for the second time (if within the last 20 unique sentences and cache not cleared) retrieves the result from the cache, avoiding an API call.
- AC3: The cache correctly evicts the oldest entries when its capacity (20 sentences) is exceeded.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

- **Relevant Files:**

    - Files to Modify:
        - `shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/nguyenmoclam/sublingo/shared/cache/TranslationCache.kt` (Enhance or reuse if structure allows distinct caches for words vs sentences, or use separate instances)
        - `shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/nguyenmoclam/sublingo/shared/data/repository/OnlineTranslationRepositoryImpl.kt` (To integrate and use `TranslationCache`)
        - Koin modules in `shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/.../di/` (To provide `TranslationCache` for sentence translations, possibly a named instance if `TranslationCache` class is generic).
    - *(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md`. `docs/data-models.md` Section 4 mentions `TranslationCache` storing `TranslationResult`.)*

- **Key Technologies:**

    - Kotlin, KMP
    - `LinkedHashMap` (for LRU cache implementation) or a dedicated KMP cache library.
    - Koin (for DI).
    - *(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md`)*

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**

    - Not applicable directly to API, but influences when API is called.

- **Data Structures:**

    - `TranslationResult`.
    - `LinkedHashMap<String, TranslationResult>` for the cache (String key is the source sentence).

- **Environment Variables:**

    - Not applicable.

- **Coding Standards Notes:**

    - If `TranslationCache` from Story 2.7 is generic enough, it can be reused with a different type parameter and capacity. Otherwise, create a similar specialized cache or enhance it.
    - Cache key for sentence: source sentence string.
    - *(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md`)*

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Evaluate `TranslationCache.kt` from Story 2.7.
    - If it's generic (e.g., `TranslationCache<K, V>`), it can be reused.
    - If not, refactor it to be generic or create a new similar `SentenceTranslationCache.kt`. Assume for now `TranslationCache` can be instantiated for `TranslationResult`.
- [ ] Task 2: Update Koin modules to provide a specific instance of `TranslationCache<String, TranslationResult>` (e.g., using a Koin named qualifier if the class is generic) for sentence translations, configured with a capacity of 20.
- [ ] Task 3: Modify `OnlineTranslationRepositoryImpl.kt`.
    - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Inject the `TranslationCache<String, TranslationResult>`.
    - [ ] Subtask 3.2: In the function that performs translation (e.g., `translateSentence(text: String)`):
        - Create a cache key from the input `text`.
        - Try to get `TranslationResult` from `cache.get(cacheKey)`.
        - If found and valid, return it.
        - If not found, proceed with the API call (via `OpenAIRemoteDataSource`).
        - If API call is successful, store the `TranslationResult` in `cache.put(cacheKey, result)` before returning.
- [ ] Task 4: Update unit tests for `OnlineTranslationRepositoryImpl`.
    - [ ] Subtask 4.1: Mock the `TranslationCache<String, TranslationResult>`.
    - [ ] Subtask 4.2: Verify cache is checked first.
    - [ ] Subtask 4.3: Verify API (data source) is called on cache miss.
    - [ ] Subtask 4.4: Verify result is put into cache after successful API call (AC1).
- [ ] Task 5: Test AC2 manually or with logging:
    - Translate a sentence.
    - Translate the same sentence again. Verify from logs/debugger that the second call does not hit the actual API (Ktor client) but returns from cache.
- [ ] Task 6: Ensure unit tests for the cache itself (from Story 2.7 or new ones if cache class is different) cover eviction for sentence cache scenario (AC3).

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

- **Unit Tests:**
    - If `TranslationCache` is reused, its existing tests should cover core LRU logic.
    - Test `OnlineTranslationRepositoryImpl` to ensure correct interaction with the sentence cache (checks cache, populates on miss from API). Mock the cache and the data source.
- **Integration Tests:** Not for MVP.
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    - AC1 & AC2: Use logging/debugger in `OnlineTranslationRepositoryImpl` to see if cache is hit or if an API call is made. Translate a sentence twice.
    - AC3: Primarily verified via cache unit tests.
- *(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md`)*
