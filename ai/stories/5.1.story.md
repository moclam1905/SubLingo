# Story 5.1: Implement Android Onboarding for "Draw Over Other Apps" Permission

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a new Android User, I want a clear, interactive guide explaining why the "Draw Over Other Apps" permission is needed and how to grant it, so I can use the floating bubble feature.

**Context:** This story is crucial for the usability of the Android floating bubble feature. The `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` ("Draw Over Other Apps") permission requires explicit user consent and navigation to system settings. This story ensures a smooth onboarding experience for this permission, explaining its necessity and guiding the user through the granting process. This builds upon the `FloatingBubbleService` stub from Story 1.4.

## Detailed Requirements

- On first launch, or when the bubble feature is first accessed via `FloatingBubbleService`, if the permission is not granted, present an onboarding Jetpack Compose screen.
- The flow should visually explain (e.g., using a GIF, short video, or sequential static images with text) the benefit of the floating bubble.
- Clearly show the steps to navigate to system settings and grant the permission.
- Provide a button/link to take the user directly to the relevant system settings screen for this permission.
- The app should gracefully handle cases where the user denies or navigeduanya away without granting permission (e.g., bubble feature remains disabled, with an option to re-initiate onboarding from settings or a UI prompt).

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: An onboarding flow for the "Draw Over Other Apps" permission is presented if the permission is not granted when the bubble feature is attempted.
- AC2: The onboarding uses visual aids and clear text.
- AC3: A direct link/button to the system settings for this permission is provided.
- AC4: The app detects whether the permission was granted after the user returns from settings.
- AC5: If permission is denied, the bubble feature is appropriately disabled or limited, and the user can find a way to re-attempt granting it later (e.g., from a settings menu item).

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

- **Relevant Files:**

    - Files to Create:
        - `composeApp/src/androidMain/kotlin/com/nguyenmoclam/sublingo/android/ui/onboarding/OverlayPermissionScreen.kt` (Jetpack Compose screen for this onboarding flow)
    - Files to Modify:
        - `composeApp/src/androidMain/kotlin/com/nguyenmoclam/sublingo/android/MainActivity.kt` (or wherever the bubble toggle/initialization logic resides, to trigger onboarding check)
        - `composeApp/src/androidMain/kotlin/com/nguyenmoclam/sublingo/android/service/FloatingBubbleService.kt` (Potentially to check permission before starting, or to be controlled by MainActivity)
        - Navigation graph if one is used, to navigate to `OverlayPermissionScreen.kt`.
    - *(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md` for file locations.)*

- **Key Technologies:**

    - Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Android SDK
    - `Settings.canDrawOverlays(context)` to check permission.
    - `Intent(Settings.ACTION_MANAGE_OVERLAY_PERMISSION, Uri.parse("package:$packageName"))` to open settings.
    - `ActivityResultLauncher` (recommended for handling result from settings activity, though direct check on resume is also possible).
    - Material 3 Components (for UI).
    - *(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md`)*

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**

    - Android Settings Intent for overlay permission.

- **Data Structures:**

    - Not applicable directly, UI state for the onboarding screen.

- **Environment Variables:**

    - Not applicable.

- **Coding Standards Notes:**

    - The onboarding screen should be clear, concise, and user-friendly.
    - Visual aids (even simple static graphics or clear text steps for MVP) are important. GIFs/videos are ideal but might be complex for initial MVP story.
    - Ensure robust checking of permission status after returning from settings.
    - *(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md`. Follow Material 3 guidelines for UI.)*

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Create `OverlayPermissionScreen.kt` Composable.
    - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Design a layout explaining the need for "Draw Over Other Apps" permission (text, placeholder for visual aid).
    - [ ] Subtask 1.2: Add a button "Grant Permission" that will launch the system settings intent.
    - [ ] Subtask 1.3: Add text explaining how to find and enable the permission in system settings.
    - [ ] Subtask 1.4: Include a "Skip" or "Later" button/option (handles AC5 gracefully).
- [ ] Task 2: In `MainActivity.kt` (or where bubble is toggled, e.g., a settings screen later):
    - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Before attempting to start `FloatingBubbleService` or show the bubble, check `Settings.canDrawOverlays(this)`.
    - [ ] Subtask 2.2: If permission is not granted, navigate to `OverlayPermissionScreen.kt`.
    - [ ] Subtask 2.3: Implement `ActivityResultLauncher` to listen for the result of returning from the settings screen (or use `onResume` to re-check permission).
- [ ] Task 3: Logic for `OverlayPermissionScreen.kt`'s "Grant Permission" button:
    - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Create and launch the `Intent(Settings.ACTION_MANAGE_OVERLAY_PERMISSION)`.
- [ ] Task 4: Implement permission check after returning from settings.
    - [ ] Subtask 4.1: If permission is granted, proceed to show the bubble or navigate back.
    - [ ] Subtask 4.2: If still not granted, update UI (e.g., show a message on `OverlayPermissionScreen` or main UI indicating feature is disabled).
- [ ] Task 5: Test the onboarding flow (AC1).
- [ ] Task 6: Verify clarity of explanation and visual aid placeholder (AC2).
- [ ] Task 7: Test the "Grant Permission" button navigates to system settings (AC3).
- [ ] Task 8: Test permission status detection after returning from settings (granted and denied scenarios) (AC4).
- [ ] Task 9: Test "Skip" or graceful handling if permission is denied (AC5). Ensure the user can attempt to grant it again later (e.g., if they try to toggle bubble again, or from a main app settings screen item).

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

- **Unit Tests:**
    - ViewModel logic (if any used for `OverlayPermissionScreen`) can be unit tested.
- **Integration Tests (Android Instrumented):**
    - Espresso tests could verify navigation to the onboarding screen and intent launching, but manual testing is key for system interactions.
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    - AC1: Revoke permission, try to enable bubble, verify onboarding screen appears.
    - AC2: Review screen content for clarity.
    - AC3: Tap button, verify correct system settings page opens.
    - AC4: Grant permission in settings, return to app, verify app recognizes it. Deny permission (or navigate back without granting), verify app recognizes this.
    - AC5: Deny permission, ensure bubble feature is disabled and user is informed. Test re-attempt flow.
- *(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md`)*
