# Story 5.2: Implement Android Onboarding for `UsageStatsManager` Permission (Conditional)

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a new Android User, if the app uses `UsageStatsManager` for auto-show/hide of the bubble, I want a clear guide explaining why this permission is needed and how to grant it, so I can benefit from the bubble appearing only when I'm using Reddit.

**Context:** This story addresses onboarding for the `PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS` permission, which is needed if the `ForegroundAppDetector.kt` feature (auto show/hide bubble based on foreground app) is implemented for MVP. This is a high-friction permission, so clear explanation is vital. The PRD notes this feature as conditional/high-friction. If not included in MVP, this story can be skipped or deferred. Assuming for now it *might* be included.

## Detailed Requirements

- **Conditionality:** Architect and PM to confirm if "auto-show/hide" (`ForegroundAppDetector.kt`) is essential for MVP or if manual toggle of the bubble is sufficient to reduce permission friction. If included:
- Present an onboarding Jetpack Compose screen if this permission is required by `ForegroundAppDetector` and not granted.
- Visually explain the benefit (bubble auto-appears/hides with Reddit).
- Clearly show steps to grant the permission in system settings for `PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS`.
- Provide a button/link to the relevant system settings screen.
- Handle denial gracefully (e.g., bubble requires manual toggle, or this specific auto-feature is disabled).

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: (If `ForegroundAppDetector` feature is included for MVP) An onboarding flow for `UsageStatsManager` permission is presented if required and not granted.
- AC2: The onboarding explains the benefit and shows how to grant the permission.
- AC3: A direct link/button to system settings is provided (`Settings.ACTION_USAGE_ACCESS_SETTINGS`).
- AC4: If permission is denied, the auto-show/hide feature is disabled, and the bubble defaults to manual toggle or another defined behavior.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

- **Relevant Files:**

    - Files to Create (if feature included):
        - `composeApp/src/androidMain/kotlin/com/nguyenmoclam/sublingo/android/ui/onboarding/UsageAccessPermissionScreen.kt`
        - `composeApp/src/androidMain/kotlin/com/nguyenmoclam/sublingo/android/core/ForegroundAppDetector.kt` (if not already stubbed)
    - Files to Modify:
        - `composeApp/src/androidMain/kotlin/com/nguyenmoclam/sublingo/android/MainActivity.kt` (or settings, to trigger this onboarding if feature is enabled by user/default)
        - `composeApp/src/androidMain/AndroidManifest.xml` (to declare `PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS` permission - note: this is a system-level permission granted via settings, not a runtime request).
    - *(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md`.)*

- **Key Technologies:**

    - Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Android SDK
    - `AppOpsManager.checkOpNoThrow()` or a similar mechanism to check `PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS` permission.
    - `Intent(Settings.ACTION_USAGE_ACCESS_SETTINGS)`.
    - *(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md`)*

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**

    - Android Settings Intent for usage access.
    - `UsageStatsManager` itself if `ForegroundAppDetector` is implemented.

- **Data Structures:**

    - UI state for onboarding.

- **Environment Variables:**

    - Not applicable.

- **Coding Standards Notes:**

    - Permission check for `PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS` is different from runtime permissions. It's granted via a special settings screen.
    - Make it clear to the user this feature is optional if it degrades to manual bubble toggle.
    - *(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md`)*

## Tasks / Subtasks

**IF `ForegroundAppDetector` IS IN MVP SCOPE:**

- [ ] Task 1: Add `tools:ignore="ProtectedPermissions"` to `PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS` permission declaration in `AndroidManifest.xml` if lint complains, as it's a system permission.
  ```xml
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS" tools:ignore="ProtectedPermissions" />
  ```
- [ ] Task 2: Create `UsageAccessPermissionScreen.kt` Composable.
    - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Explain benefit of auto-show/hide bubble with Reddit.
    - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Add "Grant Permission" button for `Settings.ACTION_USAGE_ACCESS_SETTINGS`.
    - [ ] Subtask 2.3: Add text guide for granting in settings.
    - [ ] Subtask 2.4: Include "Skip" option.
- [ ] Task 3: Implement logic (e.g., in `MainActivity` or a settings toggle) to check for `PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS` permission.
    - Use `AppOpsManager` to check.
    - If not granted and feature is desired, navigate to `UsageAccessPermissionScreen.kt`.
- [ ] Task 4: Implement "Grant Permission" button logic in `UsageAccessPermissionScreen.kt`.
- [ ] Task 5: Implement permission check after returning from settings (or on feature toggle).
    - If granted, enable `ForegroundAppDetector` functionality.
    - If denied, disable auto-feature and inform user (bubble defaults to manual toggle) (AC4).
- [ ] Task 6: Test AC1, AC2, AC3, AC4.

**IF `ForegroundAppDetector` IS NOT IN MVP SCOPE:**

- [ ] Task 1: Mark this story as "Deferred" or "Out of Scope for MVP". No implementation needed.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

- **Unit Tests:** ViewModel logic for onboarding screen state.
- **Integration Tests:** Not for MVP.
- **Manual/CLI Verification (If Implemented):**
    - AC1: Trigger flow (e.g., try to enable auto-show/hide feature), verify onboarding screen.
    - AC2: Review screen content.
    - AC3: Tap button, verify correct system settings page.
    - AC4: Deny permission, verify auto-feature is off and bubble uses manual toggle. Grant permission, verify auto-feature can be enabled.
- *(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md`)*
