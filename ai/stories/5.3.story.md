# Story 5.3: Implement iOS Onboarding for Extension Usage

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a new iOS User, I want a simple guide on how to enable and use the SubLingo Action and Share Extensions, and understand their benefits, so I can effectively translate within Reddit.

**Context:** iOS App Extensions (`SubLingoActionExtension`, `SubLingoShareExtension` from Stories 1.5, 1.6) need to be manually enabled by the user in the Share Sheet settings if not automatically done by the system. This story ensures users know how to do this and how to use the extensions. This onboarding typically happens on the first launch of the main iOS container app.

## Detailed Requirements

- On first launch of the main `iosApp` (`SubLingoApp.swift`), present a brief SwiftUI onboarding flow.
- Explain how to enable the `SubLingoActionExtension` and `SubLingoShareExtension` in the iOS Share Sheet settings if they are not automatically enabled by the system.
- Visually demonstrate (e.g., GIF or static images) how to use the Action Extension (for selected text) and the Share Extension (for screenshots).
- Briefly highlight the value proposition (e.g., "Access offline dictionary details & enhanced OpenAI translation").

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: An onboarding flow is presented on the first launch of the iOS app.
- AC2: The guide explains how to enable and use both Action and Share extensions.
- AC3: Visual aids are used to demonstrate the usage (placeholders for MVP if actual GIFs are complex).
- AC4: The value of using the extensions is briefly communicated.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

- **Relevant Files:**

    - Files to Create:
        - `iosApp/iosApp/ui/onboarding/ExtensionOnboardingView.swift` (SwiftUI view for this flow)
        - Logic for "first launch" detection (e.g., using `UserDefaults`).
    - Files to Modify:
        - `iosApp/iosApp/SubLingoApp.swift` or `iosApp/iosApp/ContentView.swift` (To present the onboarding view conditionally on first launch).
    - *(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md`.)*

- **Key Technologies:**

    - Swift, SwiftUI
    - `UserDefaults` (for "first launch" flag).
    - Potentially `TabView` or paged `ScrollView` for multi-step onboarding.
    - *(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md`)*

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**

    - Not applicable.

- **Data Structures:**

    - `Bool` flag in `UserDefaults`.

- **Environment Variables:**

    - Not applicable.

- **Coding Standards Notes:**

    - Onboarding should be dismissible.
    - Visuals should be clear. Static images showing steps are acceptable for MVP if GIFs are too time-consuming.
    - *(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md`. Follow HIG.)*

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Implement "first launch" detection logic.
    - In `SubLingoApp.swift` or `ContentView.swift`, check a `UserDefaults` flag (e.g., `hasCompletedOnboarding`).
    - If not set, show `ExtensionOnboardingView` as a sheet or full-screen modal.
- [ ] Task 2: Create `ExtensionOnboardingView.swift`.
    - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Design a multi-step UI (e.g., using `TabView` or next/back buttons).
    - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Step 1: Welcome & Value Proposition (AC4).
    - [ ] Subtask 2.3: Step 2: Explain how to enable extensions in Share Sheet (text, placeholder for image/GIF showing settings cog -\> Edit Actions...) (AC2, AC3).
    - [ ] Subtask 2.4: Step 3: Explain how to use Action Extension (select text -\> Share -\> SubLingo) (text, placeholder for image/GIF) (AC2, AC3).
    - [ ] Subtask 2.5: Step 4: Explain how to use Share Extension for images (share image -\> SubLingo) (text, placeholder for image/GIF) (AC2, AC3).
    - [ ] Subtask 2.6: Add a "Done" or "Get Started" button that sets the `UserDefaults` flag and dismisses the onboarding.
- [ ] Task 3: Test the first launch experience (AC1).
    - Delete and reinstall app to simulate first launch.
- [ ] Task 4: Review content for clarity and accuracy (AC2, AC4).
- [ ] Task 5: Verify visual aid placeholders are adequate for MVP (AC3).

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

- **Unit Tests:** Not typical for UI flows like this.
- **Integration Tests:** Not for MVP.
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    - AC1: Delete app data/reinstall. Launch app. Verify onboarding appears. Dismiss it. Relaunch. Verify it doesn't appear again.
    - AC2: Read through the instructions. Check if they are clear and accurate for enabling/using extensions.
    - AC3: Check if visual aid placeholders are present and make sense.
    - AC4: Check if the value proposition is clear.
- *(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md`)*
