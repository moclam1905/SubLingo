# Story 5.4: Create Basic Settings Screen UI (Android & iOS)

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a User, I want to access a settings screen within the app, so I can manage app preferences.

**Context:** This story establishes the main Settings screen in both the Android and iOS container apps. This screen will serve as a hub for various toggles and actions defined in subsequent stories (e.g., toggle online translation, clear cache, view privacy policy). It might use a shared KMP ViewModel for managing settings state.

## Detailed Requirements

- Implement a navigable "Settings" screen accessible from the main UI of both the Android (`composeApp`) and iOS (`iosApp`) apps.
- The screen should have a clean, simple layout.
- This screen will host the setting toggles and links defined in subsequent stories.
- Use Jetpack Compose for Android settings UI (`SettingsScreen.kt`), SwiftUI for iOS settings UI (`SettingsView.swift`).
- A KMP `shared` ViewModel (e.g., `SettingsViewModel.kt` in `com.nguyenmoclam.sublingo.shared.presentation`) can manage the settings state using `AppSettings` (Multiplatform-Settings) and be observed by the platform UIs.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: A "Settings" screen is accessible from the main app interface on Android (e.g., via an options menu or button in `MainActivity`).
- AC2: A "Settings" screen is accessible from the main app interface on iOS (e.g., via a `NavigationLink` or tab bar item in `ContentView`).
- AC3: The screen layout is clean and provides placeholders for settings items, driven by a shared KMP ViewModel if implemented.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

- **Relevant Files:**

    - Files to Create:
        - `shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/nguyenmoclam/sublingo/shared/AppSettings.kt` (If not already started for `multiplatform-settings`)
        - `shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/nguyenmoclam/sublingo/shared/presentation/SettingsViewModel.kt` (KMP ViewModel)
        - `composeApp/src/androidMain/kotlin/com/nguyenmoclam/sublingo/android/ui/settings/SettingsScreen.kt` (Android Compose UI)
        - `iosApp/iosApp/ui/settings/SettingsView.swift` (iOS SwiftUI UI)
    - Files to Modify:
        - `composeApp/src/androidMain/kotlin/com/nguyenmoclam/sublingo/android/MainActivity.kt` (or main navigation graph) to add access to Settings.
        - `iosApp/iosApp/ContentView.swift` (or main navigation structure) to add access to Settings.
        - Koin DI modules (shared, Android, iOS) to provide `AppSettings`, `SettingsViewModel`.
    - *(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md`. `multiplatform-settings` library from `docs/tech-stack.md` is key here.)*

- **Key Technologies:**

    - KMP, Kotlin, Swift
    - `multiplatform-settings` library (by Russell Wolf) for KMP persistent settings.
    - KMP ViewModel pattern (e.g., using a library like MVIKotlin or a simple observable class).
    - Jetpack Compose (Android), SwiftUI (iOS).
    - Koin for DI.
    - *(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md`)*

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**

    - `multiplatform-settings` API (`Settings` class, `putBoolean`, `getBoolean`).

- **Data Structures:**

    - `SettingsUiState` data class/struct in KMP ViewModel holding various setting values.

- **Environment Variables:**

    - Not applicable.

- **Coding Standards Notes:**

    - Settings screen should be simple and follow platform HIG.
    - KMP ViewModel helps share settings logic. Platform UIs observe this ViewModel.
    - *(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md`)*

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Add `multiplatform-settings` dependency to `shared/build.gradle.kts` if not present.
- [ ] Task 2: Create `AppSettings.kt` in `shared/commonMain`.
    - Implement `expect class SettingsHolder` and `actual`s for Android/iOS to provide `Settings` instance from `multiplatform-settings`.
    - Or directly create `Settings` instance in Koin and inject.
    - Define keys for settings (e.g., `const val KEY_ONLINE_TRANSLATION_ENABLED = "online_translation_enabled"`).
- [ ] Task 3: Create `SettingsViewModel.kt` in `shared/commonMain/presentation`.
    - Inject `Settings` (from `multiplatform-settings`).
    - Expose state (e.g., `StateFlow<SettingsUiState>`) for settings values.
    - Provide functions to update settings (these will be used by later stories).
- [ ] Task 4: Set up Koin to provide `Settings` and `SettingsViewModel`.
- [ ] Task 5: Create `SettingsScreen.kt` for Android (Jetpack Compose).
    - [ ] Subtask 5.1: Observe `SettingsViewModel`.
    - [ ] Subtask 5.2: Create a basic layout (e.g., `Scaffold` with `TopAppBar`, `Column` for settings items).
    - [ ] Subtask 5.3: Add a placeholder Text composable for "Online Translation Toggle" and "Clear Cache Button".
- [ ] Task 6: Integrate `SettingsScreen.kt` into Android main navigation (e.g., from an overflow menu in `MainActivity`). (AC1)
- [ ] Task 7: Create `SettingsView.swift` for iOS (SwiftUI).
    - [ ] Subtask 7.1: Observe `SettingsViewModel` (requires making KMP ViewModel observable from Swift, e.g. using KMP-NativeCoroutines or manual wrapping).
    - [ ] Subtask 7.2: Create a basic layout (e.g., `NavigationView` with `List` or `Form`).
    - [ ] Subtask 7.3: Add placeholder Text views for settings items.
- [ ] Task 8: Integrate `SettingsView.swift` into iOS main navigation (e.g., `NavigationLink` from `ContentView`). (AC2)
- [ ] Task 9: Verify placeholders and clean layout on both platforms (AC3).

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

- **Unit Tests:**
    - Test `SettingsViewModel`: Mock `AppSettings`. Verify it correctly reads initial settings values and that functions to update settings call `AppSettings` correctly.
- **Integration Tests:** Not for MVP.
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    - AC1: Navigate to Settings screen on Android.
    - AC2: Navigate to Settings screen on iOS.
    - AC3: Review UI on both platforms for layout and placeholders.
- *(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md`)*
