# Story 5.5: Implement "Toggle Online Sentence Translation" Setting

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a User, I want to be able to enable or disable online sentence translation via a setting, so I can control data usage and choose my preferred translation method.

**Context:** This story adds a functional toggle to the Settings screen (created in Story 5.4). It allows users to control whether the app uses the `OnlineTranslationService` (from Epic 4). The setting's state must be persisted and respected by the KMP shared logic.

## Detailed Requirements

- Add a switch/toggle control on the Settings screen (Android & iOS) labeled "Enable Online Sentence Translation" (or similar).
- The state of this toggle should be persisted using the KMP `AppSettings` (Multiplatform-Settings).
- The KMP `OnlineTranslationService` (or the domain logic calling it) must respect this setting. If disabled, it should not attempt to make API calls and should perhaps return a specific state/error indicating the feature is off.
- Default state: Enabled (to be confirmed, but typically good for showcasing features). PRD does not specify default; assume enabled for now.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: A toggle for online sentence translation is present on the Settings screen on both platforms.
- AC2: The setting's state is persisted via KMP `AppSettings` and respected across app sessions.
- AC3: If the setting is OFF, the KMP `shared` module does not attempt to call the online translation API, and the UI may inform the user that the feature is disabled if an online translation would have otherwise occurred.
- AC4: If the setting is ON, online translation functions as designed in Epic 4.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

- **Relevant Files:**

    - Files to Modify:
        - `shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/nguyenmoclam/sublingo/shared/AppSettings.kt` (Add key and methods for this setting)
        - `shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/nguyenmoclam/sublingo/shared/presentation/SettingsViewModel.kt` (Expose state and update function for this toggle)
        - `shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/nguyenmoclam/sublingo/shared/domain/repository/OnlineTranslationRepositoryImpl.kt` (or relevant UseCase, to check this setting before making API call)
        - `composeApp/src/androidMain/kotlin/com/nguyenmoclam/sublingo/android/ui/settings/SettingsScreen.kt` (Add Compose `Switch`)
        - `iosApp/iosApp/ui/settings/SettingsView.swift` (Add SwiftUI `Toggle`)
    - *(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md`.)*

- **Key Technologies:**

    - `multiplatform-settings`
    - KMP ViewModel
    - Jetpack Compose `Switch`
    - SwiftUI `Toggle`
    - *(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md`)*

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**

    - `AppSettings.getBoolean("KEY_ONLINE_TRANSLATION_ENABLED", defaultValue = true)`
    - `AppSettings.putBoolean("KEY_ONLINE_TRANSLATION_ENABLED", value)`

- **Data Structures:**

    - Boolean state for the toggle.

- **Environment Variables:**

    - Not applicable.

- **Coding Standards Notes:**

    - Default value for the setting should be true (enabled).
    - The KMP service/repository performing online translation must gate the API call based on this setting.
    - *(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md`)*

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: In `AppSettings.kt` (KMP shared):
    - Define `KEY_ONLINE_TRANSLATION_ENABLED`.
    - Add functions `isOnlineTranslationEnabled(): Boolean` and `setOnlineTranslationEnabled(enabled: Boolean)`. Default to `true`.
- [ ] Task 2: In `SettingsViewModel.kt` (KMP shared):
    - Expose the current state of `isOnlineTranslationEnabled` to the UI state.
    - Create a function `updateOnlineTranslationPreference(isEnabled: Boolean)` that calls `appSettings.setOnlineTranslationEnabled()`.
- [ ] Task 3: In `OnlineTranslationRepositoryImpl.kt` (or relevant UseCase in KMP shared):
    - Before making an API call, check `appSettings.isOnlineTranslationEnabled()`.
    - If false, return immediately (e.g., with a specific `NetworkResult.Error` indicating feature is disabled, or null).
- [ ] Task 4: Implement the toggle in Android `SettingsScreen.kt`.
    - Add a `Row` with `Text("Enable Online Sentence Translation")` and a `Switch` composable.
    - `Switch` checked state comes from `SettingsViewModel`.
    - `onCheckedChange` calls `viewModel.updateOnlineTranslationPreference()`. (AC1 Android)
- [ ] Task 5: Implement the toggle in iOS `SettingsView.swift`.
    - Add a `Toggle` view with label "Enable Online Sentence Translation".
    - Bind its state to a property in `SettingsViewModel` (via `@Published` property and two-way binding if possible, or call update function). (AC1 iOS)
- [ ] Task 6: Test persistence (AC2):
    - Change toggle state, close and reopen app, verify state is preserved in Settings and reflected in behavior.
- [ ] Task 7: Test behavior when OFF (AC3):
    - Turn toggle OFF. Attempt an online translation (e.g., OCR a sentence). Verify no API call is made (check logs/debugger) and UI shows appropriate feedback (e.g., "Online translation disabled" or falls back to offline).
- [ ] Task 8: Test behavior when ON (AC4):
    - Turn toggle ON. Attempt an online translation. Verify it works as in Epic 4.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

- **Unit Tests:**
    - Test `SettingsViewModel` logic for reading and updating the toggle preference via mocked `AppSettings`.
    - Test KMP `OnlineTranslationRepositoryImpl` (or UseCase) logic: mock `AppSettings` to return true/false for the setting, and verify API call is/is not made.
- **Integration Tests:** Not for MVP.
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    - AC1: Visually confirm toggle on both platforms.
    - AC2: Change setting, restart app, confirm setting persists.
    - AC3: Turn setting off. Try to translate a sentence. Verify no network activity for translation and appropriate UI feedback.
    - AC4: Turn setting on. Try to translate a sentence. Verify it works.
