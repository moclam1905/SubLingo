# Story 5.7: Display Privacy Policy Link in Settings

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a User, I want to easily access the app's Privacy Policy, so I can understand how my data is handled.

**Context:** This story adds a link to the Privacy Policy on the Settings screen (Story 5.4). Displaying a privacy policy is a standard requirement for apps, especially those using network features or handling user text. The content of the policy itself is covered in Story 6.2. This story focuses on making it accessible.

## Detailed Requirements

- Add a tappable item on the Settings screen (Android & iOS) labeled "Privacy Policy."
- Tapping this item should open the app's Privacy Policy.
- For MVP, the Privacy Policy can be a simple, locally bundled HTML or Markdown file displayed in a platform-native WebView or a dedicated rich text view. A URL to a hosted policy is also acceptable if simpler for MVP. (The content of `docs/privacy-policy.md` needs to be drafted - see Story 6.2).

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: A "Privacy Policy" link/button is present on the Settings screen on both platforms.
- AC2: Tapping the link successfully displays the Privacy Policy content to the user (either from a bundled asset or a webview).
- AC3: The mechanism to display the Privacy Policy is functional. (Content accuracy is covered in Story 6.2).

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

- **Relevant Files:**

    - Files to Create:
        - `composeApp/src/main/assets/privacy_policy.html` (or `.md`) (Placeholder content for now)
        - `iosApp/iosApp/Resources/privacy_policy.html` (or `.md`) (Placeholder content)
        - Potentially a new Activity/Composable (Android) or View (iOS) to host WebView or render Markdown.
    - Files to Modify:
        - `composeApp/src/androidMain/kotlin/com/nguyenmoclam/sublingo/android/ui/settings/SettingsScreen.kt`
        - `iosApp/iosApp/ui/settings/SettingsView.swift`
    - *(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md`. `docs/privacy-policy.md` will hold the source markdown.)*

- **Key Technologies:**

    - Android: `WebView` or a Markdown rendering library for Compose. Intent to open URL if hosted online.
    - iOS: `SFSafariViewController` (for URL), `WKWebView`, or a Swift Markdown rendering library.
    - *(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md`)*

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**

    - Android `WebView.loadUrl("file:///android_asset/privacy_policy.html")` or `WebView.loadDataWithBaseURL()`.
    - iOS `WKWebView.loadFileURL(...)` or `SFSafariViewController(url: URL(string:"..."))`.

- **Data Structures:**

    - Not applicable.

- **Environment Variables:**

    - Not applicable.

- **Coding Standards Notes:**

    - If using WebView, ensure it's configured securely (e.g., disable JavaScript if displaying static local HTML/Markdown).
    - Bundling the policy is more reliable for MVP than hosting it, unless a URL is already available.
    - *(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md`)*

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Create placeholder `privacy_policy.html` (or `.md`) file with simple "Privacy Policy Content Goes Here" text.
    - Place in `composeApp/src/main/assets/` for Android.
    - Place in `iosApp/iosApp/Resources/` (and add to Xcode project target) for iOS.
- [ ] Task 2: Implement "Privacy Policy" item in Android `SettingsScreen.kt`.
    - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Add a tappable `Row` or `Button` labeled "Privacy Policy" (AC1 Android).
    - [ ] Subtask 2.2: On tap, navigate to a new Activity/Composable that hosts a `WebView` to display the local HTML file, or parse and display Markdown. (AC2, AC3 Android).
- [ ] Task 3: Implement "Privacy Policy" item in iOS `SettingsView.swift`.
    - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Add a `NavigationLink` or `Button` labeled "Privacy Policy" (AC1 iOS).
    - [ ] Subtask 3.2: On tap, present a `WKWebView` (loading local HTML) or `SFSafariViewController` (if hosted URL decided), or a view that renders Markdown. (AC2, AC3 iOS).
- [ ] Task 4: Test tapping the link on Android and verify placeholder content is displayed.
- [ ] Task 5: Test tapping the link on iOS and verify placeholder content is displayed.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

- **Unit Tests:** Not typical for this UI navigation.
- **Integration Tests:** Not for MVP.
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    - AC1: Visually confirm link/button on Settings screen on both platforms.
    - AC2, AC3: Tap the link. Verify that a view appears displaying the placeholder content of the privacy policy. Check for basic rendering and scrollability if content were longer.
- *(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md`)*
