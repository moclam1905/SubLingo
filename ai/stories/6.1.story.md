# Story 6.1: System-Wide Error Handling Review and Enhancement

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a Developer, I need to review and enhance error handling across all application features (Epics 1-5) to ensure that users receive clear, informative, and actionable error messages for any foreseeable issue, utilizing the KMP shared error reporting structure.

**Context:** This story is critical for application stability and user experience. It builds upon the error handling established in earlier stories (especially Story 4.5 for online errors) and aims to make it comprehensive across the entire app. It relies on the shared error reporting structure defined in Tech Story G.2.

## Detailed Requirements

- Systematically review all user flows and ensure KMP services/use cases return defined error types (from Tech Story G.2).
- Platform UIs (Android bubble/main app, iOS extensions/main app) must map these shared error types to user-friendly messages for:
    - Offline dictionary lookups (word not found, dictionary load error - if `OfflineDictionaryService` reports it).
    - OCR processing (no text detected, low confidence - as reported by platform OCR providers to KMP, then to UI).
    - Online sentence translation (network issues, API errors, timeouts, quota limits - building on Story 4.5).
    - Permission denials and their consequences (platform-specific handling).
    - TTS initialization/playback errors (as reported by KMP `TtsPlayer` actuals).
- Ensure all error messages are user-friendly (avoid technical jargon).
- Where possible, suggest recovery steps or direct users to relevant settings (e.g., "Check internet connection," "Enable online translation in Settings").
- Verify that the app remains stable and does not crash when errors occur.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: All known error conditions in core features have corresponding user-facing error messages derived from the shared error structure or platform-specific error handling.
- AC2: Error messages are clear, concise, and helpful to the user.
- AC3: The application gracefully handles and recovers from these errors without crashing.
- AC4: A consistent error display mechanism (e.g., snackbars, dialogs, inline messages) is used across the app where appropriate.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

- **Relevant Files:**
    - Files to Modify:
        - Potentially all ViewModel and UI files across Android (`composeApp`) and iOS (`iosApp`, including extensions) to refine error display.
        - KMP shared services/repositories/use cases to ensure they consistently use the shared error structure (Tech Story G.2).
        - `shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/nguyenmoclam/sublingo/shared/util/NetworkResult.kt` (or similar error structure defined in Tech Story G.2).
    - _(Hint: This story involves a broad review and refinement rather than creating many new files.)_

- **Key Technologies:**
    - Kotlin, Swift, KMP
    - Jetpack Compose (Android: `Snackbar`, `AlertDialog`, conditional UI based on error state)
    - SwiftUI (iOS: `Alert`, conditional UI based on error state)
    - The shared error reporting structure (e.g., sealed class with error types).
    - _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md`, `docs/coding-standards.md` Section 3 Error Handling Strategy.)_

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    - Focus is on handling errors from previously integrated APIs/SDKs (Offline DB, OCR, Online API, TTS).

- **Data Structures:**
    - The shared error model (e.g., `NetworkResult.Error`, `DataResponse.Error` or custom sealed classes with specific error types/codes).

- **Environment Variables:**
    - Not applicable.

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
    - Error messages should be internationalized if localization is planned post-MVP (for MVP, English is fine).
    - Prioritize clear, non-technical language.
    - Ensure consistency in how errors are presented to the user on each platform.
    - Test thoroughly by simulating various error conditions.
    - _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for error handling strategy.)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Review KMP `OfflineDictionaryService` (and repository/use case):
    - Ensure errors like "dictionary load failure" (if possible) or "query execution error" are wrapped in the shared error structure.
    - Ensure "word not found" is handled as a specific non-error state (e.g., `null` result) rather than an exception, but UI should show a message.
- [ ] Task 2: Review platform OCR providers (`MlKitOcrProvider`, `VisionOcrProvider`):
    - Ensure "no text detected" or "low confidence" results are propagated clearly (e.g., specific error type or null/empty result that UI can interpret).
- [ ] Task 3: Review `OnlineTranslationService` (repository/data source):
    - Verify comprehensive error handling from Story 4.5 is robust and uses the shared error structure correctly.
- [ ] Task 4: Review platform `TtsPlayer` actual implementations:
    - Ensure initialization failures or playback errors are reported back to the caller (e.g., via callback, state update) so UI can react.
- [ ] Task 5: Review Android UI (`BubbleViewModel`, `BubbleContent`, `SettingsScreen`, onboarding screens):
    - For each interaction point with KMP services or platform services, ensure all possible error states are handled.
    - Display user-friendly messages for each error.
    - Implement consistent error display (e.g., using `SnackbarHostState` for transient errors in bubble, or inline messages).
- [ ] Task 6: Review iOS UI (`ActionViewModel`, `ShareViewModel`, `SettingsView`, onboarding views):
    - Similar to Android, ensure all error states are handled and mapped to user-friendly messages using SwiftUI `Alerts` or inline text.
- [ ] Task 7: Review permission handling flows (Android `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW`, `PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS`):
    - Ensure clear feedback if permissions are denied and features are consequently unavailable.
- [ ] Task 8: Perform systematic error testing (AC1, AC2, AC3, AC4):
    - Simulate network off, invalid API key (if possible), force TTS errors, provide invalid OCR images, etc.
    - Verify appropriate messages and app stability.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.
- **Unit Tests:**
    - ViewModel unit tests should cover mapping different shared error types to specific UI error message states/flags.
    - KMP service/repository unit tests should confirm they correctly generate shared error types for various underlying issues (mocking dependencies to throw exceptions).
- **Integration Tests:** Not for MVP.
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    - AC1, AC2: Manually trigger various error conditions (no network, incorrect API key for online, bad image for OCR, TTS issues if simulatable) across all features. Verify user-facing messages are appropriate.
    - AC3: Ensure the app does not crash under any tested error condition.
    - AC4: Review error message presentation consistency (dialogs, snackbars, inline messages) across the app.
- _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` for error testing approaches.)_
