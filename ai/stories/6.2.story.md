# Story 6.2: Finalize and Integrate Privacy Policy Content

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a PM/Developer, I need to finalize the content of the Privacy Policy (`docs/privacy-policy.md`) and ensure it's correctly integrated and accessible within the app as per Story 5.7.

**Context:** This story ensures the legal and transparency aspects related to user privacy are addressed. It involves finalizing the text of the Privacy Policy to accurately reflect the app's data handling practices (especially concerning OCR and online translation) and ensuring this policy is correctly displayed within the app from the Settings screen.

## Detailed Requirements

- Review and finalize the text of the Privacy Policy. It must accurately reflect:
    - Data collected (selected text, text from OCR, cached translations, settings preferences).
    - How data is processed (on-device for OCR/offline dictionary, text to OpenAI/OpenRouter for online translation).
    - API key usage and storage (acknowledging current MVP build-time configuration risk and advising users about data sent to OpenAI).
    - Explicitly state that no images are stored by SubLingo post-OCR.
    - Details about the translation cache (on-device, user-clearable).
    - Use of permissions (Overlay, UsageStats if applicable, Clipboard access if relevant).
- Ensure the finalized Privacy Policy content is correctly displayed when accessed from the Settings screen on both Android and iOS (using the mechanism from Story 5.7).

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: The Privacy Policy content in `docs/privacy-policy.md` is finalized and accurately reflects all data handling practices of the MVP.
- AC2: The finalized Privacy Policy is accessible from the Settings screen on both platforms and displays correctly.
- AC3: The display of the Privacy Policy is clear and legible.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

- **Relevant Files:**
    - Files to Create/Modify:
        - `docs/privacy-policy.md` (Finalize content here).
        - `composeApp/src/main/assets/privacy_policy.html` (or `.md` if using Markdown renderer) - update with finalized content.
        - `iosApp/iosApp/Resources/privacy_policy.html` (or `.md`) - update with finalized content.
        - Android Activity/Composable for displaying policy (from Story 5.7) - ensure it renders final content correctly.
        - iOS View for displaying policy (from Story 5.7) - ensure it renders final content correctly.
    - _(Hint: This story is primarily content finalization and ensuring the display mechanism from Story 5.7 works with actual content.)_

- **Key Technologies:**
    - Markdown or HTML for policy content.
    - Android `WebView` / Compose Markdown renderer.
    - iOS `WKWebView` / SwiftUI Markdown renderer or `SFSafariViewController`.
    - _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md`)_

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    - Not applicable.

- **Data Structures:**
    - Not applicable.

- **Environment Variables:**
    - Not applicable.

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
    - The Privacy Policy should be written in clear, simple language.
    - Ensure all points from the "Detailed Requirements" section are covered in the policy text.
    - _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md`. PRD FR8 and `docs/prd.md` "Privacy" section under "Other Technical Considerations" are relevant.)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Review `prd.md`, `architecture.md`, `api-reference.md`, `environment-vars.md`, and `data-models.md` to gather all data handling details.
- [ ] Task 2: Draft/Finalize the content of `docs/privacy-policy.md` covering all required points:
    - Data collected (text, OCR data, settings, cache).
    - Data processing (on-device OCR/dictionary, text to OpenAI).
    - API Key risk acknowledgement and OpenAI data notice.
    - No image storage statement.
    - Translation cache details.
    - Permissions usage.
- [ ] Task 3: Convert the finalized Markdown content from `docs/privacy-policy.md` into the format used for in-app display (e.g., HTML if using WebViews, or ensure the Markdown renderer can handle it).
- [ ] Task 4: Update the bundled `privacy_policy.html` (or `.md`) file in Android assets (`composeApp/src/main/assets/`) with the final content.
- [ ] Task 5: Update the bundled `privacy_policy.html` (or `.md`) file in iOS resources (`iosApp/iosApp/Resources/`) with the final content.
- [ ] Task 6: Test accessing the Privacy Policy from the Settings screen on Android. Verify it displays the finalized content correctly and legibly (AC2, AC3 Android).
- [ ] Task 7: Test accessing the Privacy Policy from the Settings screen on iOS. Verify it displays the finalized content correctly and legibly (AC2, AC3 iOS).
- [ ] Task 8: Perform a final review of the displayed policy content against the requirements to ensure accuracy (AC1).

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.
- **Unit Tests:** Not applicable for content.
- **Integration Tests:** Not for MVP.
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    - AC1: Review the content of `docs/privacy-policy.md` and compare it against the actual app functionality and data handling practices.
    - AC2: Navigate to Settings -> Privacy Policy on both Android and iOS. Confirm the policy is displayed.
    - AC3: Read through the displayed policy on both platforms. Ensure it's clear, legible, and correctly formatted (no broken links if HTML, good rendering if Markdown).
- _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md`)_
