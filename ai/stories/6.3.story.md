# Story 6.3: Refine Android Floating Bubble UX/UI

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As an Android User, I want the floating bubble to be intuitive, non-obtrusive, and visually polished, providing clear feedback for its state.

**Context:** This story focuses on polishing the user experience and interface of the Android floating bubble, which is a primary interaction point for SubLingo on Android. It involves refining its visual design, interaction (dragging, dismissal), feedback mechanisms (loading, results, errors), and responsiveness based on initial internal testing.

## Detailed Requirements

- Based on internal testing, refine the bubble's (`FloatingBubbleService` and its Compose UI):
    - **Visual Design:** Ensure it's visually appealing (Material 3), distinct but not overly distracting. Consider a subtle idle state vs. active/loading state.
    - **Interaction:** Smooth dragging, easy dismissal (if applicable, e.g., drag to a target), clear tap target.
    - **Feedback:** Visual feedback when tapped (e.g., ripple, state change), loading indicators during processing (OCR, translation), clear display of results or errors.
    - **Responsiveness:** Ensure the bubble responds quickly to interactions and KMP core responses.
- Test the bubble's behavior over various apps (especially Reddit) and screen orientations.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: The Android floating bubble's visual appearance is polished and adheres to Material 3 guidelines.
- AC2: Bubble interactions (drag, tap, dismiss) are smooth and responsive.
- AC3: Clear visual feedback is provided for bubble states (idle, active/loading, showing result, error).
- AC4: The bubble maintains its functionality and appearance consistently across different scenarios (e.g., over different apps, screen orientation changes if bubble persists).

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

- **Relevant Files:**
    - Files to Modify:
        - `composeApp/src/androidMain/kotlin/com/nguyenmoclam/sublingo/android/service/FloatingBubbleService.kt` (For interaction logic, drag, dismiss, state management)
        - `composeApp/src/androidMain/kotlin/com/nguyenmoclam/sublingo/android/ui/bubble/BubbleContent.kt` (For visual design, state-dependent UI, feedback elements)
        - `composeApp/src/androidMain/kotlin/com/nguyenmoclam/sublingo/android/ui/bubble/BubbleViewModel.kt` (For managing states reflected in UI)
        - `composeApp/src/androidMain/kotlin/com/nguyenmoclam/sublingo/android/ui/theme/Theme.kt` (Ensure Material 3 theme is correctly applied)
    - _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md`.)_

- **Key Technologies:**
    - Jetpack Compose (Material 3 components, animations, touch handling)
    - Android Services, `WindowManager`
    - _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md`. `docs/architecture.md` describes the FloatingBubbleService.)_

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    - Android `WindowManager` for updating bubble position/state.
    - Jetpack Compose animation APIs for smooth transitions if applicable.
    - Modifier `.pointerInput` for advanced drag/tap gesture handling if needed beyond basic View touch listeners.

- **Data Structures:**
    - UI state in `BubbleViewModel` to drive different visual appearances/feedback.

- **Environment Variables:**
    - Not applicable.

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
    - Follow Material 3 design principles.
    - Prioritize smooth performance for bubble interactions.
    - Ensure state changes are handled robustly (e.g., during rapid taps or configuration changes).
    - Consider accessibility for the bubble (e.g., sufficient tap target size, clear visual states).
    - _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` Section 6 for Android platform guidelines.)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Review current bubble visual design.
    - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Update bubble shape, color, icon (if any) to align with Material 3 and be visually distinct yet unobtrusive.
    - [ ] Subtask 1.2: Design distinct visual states for idle, loading (e.g., progress indicator within or around bubble), displaying content, and showing an error icon/color.
- [ ] Task 2: Review and refine bubble interaction.
    - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Ensure dragging is smooth and doesn't lag. Test edge cases (dragging quickly, dragging to screen edges).
    - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Implement or refine bubble dismissal (e.g., if dragging to a specific screen area, or via a long-press menu if that's a desired feature - current plan is manual toggle via app UI/settings). Confirm tap target is adequate.
- [ ] Task 3: Enhance feedback mechanisms.
    - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Add touch feedback (e.g., ripple effect on tap if using Material components).
    - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Implement clear loading indicators within `BubbleContent.kt` based on `BubbleViewModel` state.
    - [ ] Subtask 3.3: Ensure results and error messages (from Story 6.1) are displayed clearly within the bubble's UI constraints.
- [ ] Task 4: Test responsiveness.
    - [ ] Subtask 4.1: Ensure quick response to taps and state changes from KMP core (translation results).
- [ ] Task 5: Test bubble behavior over various apps (especially Reddit) and screen orientations.
    - Verify consistent appearance and functionality. Handle configuration changes gracefully if the bubble is meant to persist (current design seems to be manually toggled).
- [ ] Task 6: Iterate on UI based on internal feedback until polished (AC1, AC2, AC3, AC4).

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.
- **Unit Tests:**
    - ViewModel tests for state transitions that drive UI changes.
- **Integration Tests (Android Instrumented):**
    - Espresso tests for bubble interactions could be complex; manual testing is primary.
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    - AC1: Visually inspect the bubble design against Material 3 principles and overall aesthetic.
    - AC2: Manually interact with the bubble: drag it, tap it, (dismiss it if applicable). Assess smoothness and responsiveness.
    - AC3: Trigger different states: perform a quick offline lookup, a longer online lookup (to see loading), trigger an error. Verify visual feedback for each state.
    - AC4: Use the bubble over Reddit app, then switch to another app and back (if bubble is persistent). Rotate screen if bubble is active and expected to adapt.
- _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` for E2E testing.)_
