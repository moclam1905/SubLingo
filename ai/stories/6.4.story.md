# Story 6.4: Refine iOS Extension UX/UI

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As an iOS User, I want the Action and Share Extensions (`SubLingoActionExtension`, `SubLingoShareExtension`) to be fast, easy to understand, and visually consistent with a polished app experience.

**Context:** This story mirrors Story 6.3 but for the iOS App Extensions. It focuses on polishing their SwiftUI UI/UX, ensuring they are quick to launch, intuitive, and provide clear feedback, aligning with Apple's Human Interface Guidelines (HIG).

## Detailed Requirements

- Based on internal testing, refine the SwiftUI UI/UX of both Action and Share extensions:
    - **Launch Speed:** Ensure extensions launch as quickly as possible (minimize Koin init time if it impacts extension launch).
    - **Clarity:** Make sure the purpose and flow within each extension are immediately understandable.
    - **Visual Design:** Consistent and clean SwiftUI UI for displaying information, results, and errors, adhering to iOS HIG.
    - **Feedback:** Clear loading indicators and feedback messages.
- Test extensions with various shared content types (text, different images) and from different apps (especially Reddit).

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: iOS Action and Share Extensions launch quickly.
- AC2: The UI within extensions is clear, intuitive, and visually polished.
- AC3: Clear visual feedback is provided for loading states, results, and errors within the extensions.
- AC4: Extensions handle various valid inputs gracefully and provide informative messages for invalid inputs.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

- **Relevant Files:**
    - Files to Modify:
        - `iosApp/SubLingoActionExtension/ActionView.swift` (and its `ActionViewController.swift` or equivalent)
        - `iosApp/SubLingoActionExtension/ActionViewModel.swift`
        - `iosApp/SubLingoShareExtension/ShareView.swift` (and its `ShareViewController.swift` or equivalent)
        - `iosApp/SubLingoShareExtension/ShareViewModel.swift` (or reuse `ActionViewModel` if applicable)
        - Koin initialization logic for extensions (Tech Story I.2) - review for performance.
    - _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md`.)_

- **Key Technologies:**
    - SwiftUI (Layout, components, animations)
    - iOS App Extension lifecycle.
    - Combine / Swift Concurrency for state management.
    - _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md`. Adherence to Apple HIG is key.)_

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    - Not applicable directly, focuses on UI presentation of data from KMP services.

- **Data Structures:**
    - UI state in ViewModels driving SwiftUI views.

- **Environment Variables:**
    - Not applicable.

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
    - Optimize Koin initialization if it's a bottleneck for extension launch. Consider what truly needs to be initialized for the extension's scope.
    - UI should be adaptive (e.g., to different text lengths, device sizes within extension view constraints).
    - Use SF Symbols for iconography where appropriate.
    - _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` Section 6 for iOS platform guidelines.)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Profile extension launch times. If slow, investigate Koin initialization or other setup costs within the extension lifecycle (Tech Story I.2 may need review). (AC1)
- [ ] Task 2: Review UI flow for both Action and Share extensions.
    - Ensure clear titles, instructions (if any), and button labels.
    - Make sure the flow from receiving shared data to displaying results/errors is logical and intuitive. (AC2)
- [ ] Task 3: Refine visual design of extension UIs.
    - Ensure consistency with iOS HIG (fonts, spacing, navigation, modal presentation if used).
    - Polish layout, alignment, and use of SwiftUI components. (AC2)
- [ ] Task 4: Enhance feedback mechanisms.
    - Implement clear loading indicators (`ProgressView`) during KMP service calls or OCR.
    - Ensure error messages (from Story 6.1) and "No text found" messages are displayed clearly and appropriately. (AC3)
- [ ] Task 5: Test with various inputs:
    - Action Extension: Short text, long text, text with special characters.
    - Share Extension: Different screenshot sizes, images from various sources, images with/without clear text.
    - Verify graceful handling of valid inputs and informative messages for unexpected or invalid inputs (e.g., sharing a non-image to Share Extension if not filtered by activation rules). (AC4)
- [ ] Task 6: Test extensions invoked from different apps (e.g., Safari, Notes, Photos, Reddit app).
- [ ] Task 7: Iterate on UI/UX based on internal feedback.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.
- **Unit Tests:**
    - ViewModel tests for state transitions that drive UI changes.
- **Integration Tests (XCUITest):**
    - XCUITest for App Extensions can be complex; manual testing is primary for MVP.
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    - AC1: Manually time or perceive launch speed of extensions from Share Sheet.
    - AC2: Review UI for clarity, intuitiveness, and visual appeal.
    - AC3: Trigger loading states (by processing text/image) and error states. Verify feedback.
    - AC4: Test with diverse valid inputs. Try sharing unexpected item types to see how activation rules and error handling cope.
- _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md`.)_
