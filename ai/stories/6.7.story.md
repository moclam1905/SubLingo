# Story 6.7: Final Onboarding Flow Review and Polish

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a PM/QA, I want to review the complete onboarding flows on both Android and iOS for clarity, accuracy, and user-friendliness, ensuring all steps are correct and easy to follow.

**Context:** This story ensures the user's first experience with SubLingo is positive and effective. It involves a thorough review of all onboarding screens created in Epic 5 (Stories 5.1 for Android Overlay, 5.2 for Android UsageStats if included, 5.3 for iOS Extensions), checking for clarity, accuracy of instructions, and visual polish.

## Detailed Requirements

- Go through the entire first-time user experience on both platforms, focusing on:
    - Android permission onboarding (Draw Over Other Apps - Story 5.1, UsageStatsManager if implemented - Story 5.2).
    - iOS extension enabling and usage guide (Story 5.3).
- Check all instructional text for clarity, conciseness, and grammar.
- Verify that all visual aids (GIFs, images, or placeholders) are accurate, easy to understand, and culturally appropriate for the target Vietnamese users (though MVP text is English).
- Ensure navigation through onboarding is smooth, users can exit/skip where appropriate (and re-access info if needed, e.g., via a help section in settings - though re-access might be a separate feature if not part of initial onboarding design).

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: The Android onboarding flow for permissions is verified as clear, accurate, and guides the user effectively.
- AC2: The iOS onboarding flow for extensions is verified as clear, accurate, and helpful.
- AC3: All text and visual elements in the onboarding flows are polished and free of errors.
- AC4: The onboarding process feels smooth, professional, and instills confidence.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

- **Relevant Files:**
    - Files to Review/Modify:
        - `composeApp/src/androidMain/kotlin/com/nguyenmoclam/sublingo/android/ui/onboarding/OverlayPermissionScreen.kt`
        - `composeApp/src/androidMain/kotlin/com/nguyenmoclam/sublingo/android/ui/onboarding/UsageAccessPermissionScreen.kt` (if applicable)
        - `iosApp/iosApp/ui/onboarding/ExtensionOnboardingView.swift`
        - Any related ViewModel or logic files controlling these onboarding flows.
    - _(Hint: This is a review and refinement story, focusing on existing onboarding components.)_

- **Key Technologies:**
    - Jetpack Compose (Android)
    - SwiftUI (iOS)
    - _(Hint: Focus is on content, clarity, and flow, not new tech.)_

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    - Not applicable.

- **Data Structures:**
    - Not applicable.

- **Environment Variables:**
    - Not applicable.

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
    - Pay attention to text copy: it should be encouraging and simple.
    - If visual aid placeholders were used in Epic 5, this story might involve creating/integrating the actual simple static images or ensuring text descriptions are very clear.
    - Test on devices with different screen sizes to ensure layouts are responsive.
    - _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md`. PRD FR6 refers to interactive guides.)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: On an Android test device (preferably clean install or data cleared):
    - Trigger and complete the "Draw Over Other Apps" permission onboarding (Story 5.1).
    - Review all text for clarity, grammar, accuracy of steps. (AC1, AC3 Android part)
    - Assess visual aids (or placeholders) for helpfulness.
    - Check navigation (granting, denying, skipping if available). (AC4 Android part)
- [ ] Task 2: (If Story 5.2 was implemented) On Android, trigger and complete `UsageStatsManager` permission onboarding.
    - Perform similar review as Task 1 for this flow. (AC1, AC3 Android part)
- [ ] Task 3: On an iOS test device (clean install or data cleared):
    - Trigger and complete the iOS Extension usage onboarding (Story 5.3).
    - Review all text for clarity, grammar, accuracy of steps for enabling/using extensions. (AC2, AC3 iOS part)
    - Assess visual aids (or placeholders).
    - Check navigation and dismiss behavior. (AC4 iOS part)
- [ ] Task 4: Collect all identified issues (typos, unclear instructions, confusing navigation, visual glitches).
- [ ] Task 5: Implement necessary corrections and polish for text, visuals (if simple static images are being added/refined), and flow in the respective onboarding Composable/SwiftUI Views.
- [ ] Task 6: Re-test the flows after fixes to ensure all ACs are met.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.
- **Unit Tests:** Not applicable for UI review.
- **Integration Tests:** Not for MVP.
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    - This entire story is a manual verification and refinement process.
    - AC1: Walk through Android permission onboarding. Does it make sense? Is it easy to follow? Does it lead to the correct outcome?
    - AC2: Walk through iOS extension onboarding. Is it clear how to enable and use extensions?
    - AC3: Proofread all text. Check visuals for clarity and quality (even if simple).
    - AC4: Assess overall flow. Does it feel smooth? Can user get stuck? Is it professional?
- _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md`, particularly E2E testing of onboarding flows.)_
