# Story 6.8: General UI/UX Consistency and Polish Pass

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a Developer/QA, I want to perform a general review of the entire application UI on both platforms to identify and fix minor inconsistencies, typos, layout issues, or awkward interactions.

**Context:** This is a final catch-all UI/UX polish story before considering the MVP complete. It involves a holistic review of all screens and interaction points developed throughout Epics 1-5, looking for small issues that might have been missed or areas that could be slightly improved for a more professional feel.

## Detailed Requirements

- Review all screens, dialogs, and UI elements in the app (main app UI in `composeApp`/`iosApp`, Android bubble, iOS extensions).
- Check for:
    - Consistent terminology and button labels (consider English and Vietnamese if any UI text is localized for MVP - current MVP is English UI).
    - Consistent font usage and text alignment.
    - Consistent use of colors and iconography (if any defined).
    - Proper layout and spacing on different representative screen sizes/orientations for target devices.
    - Any remaining typos or grammatical errors in UI text.
    - Any awkward or confusing user interactions not caught in specific feature testing.
- Fix identified minor issues. Larger redesigns are out of scope for this story.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: At least 10 minor UI/UX polish items are identified and addressed across both platforms (or a thorough review is documented if fewer than 10 significant items are found).
- AC2: The application presents a more consistent and professional look and feel.
- AC3: Obvious typos and grammatical errors in the UI are corrected.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

- **Relevant Files:**
    - Files to Modify: Potentially any UI file across `composeApp` and `iosApp` (including extensions and onboarding).
        - `.../ui/theme/Theme.kt` (Android) or equivalent theming files.
        - Specific Composable functions or SwiftUI Views.
    - _(Hint: This involves a broad sweep of the UI codebase.)_

- **Key Technologies:**
    - Jetpack Compose (Android)
    - SwiftUI (iOS)
    - Android Studio Layout Inspector / Compose Preview tools.
    - Xcode UI Inspector / SwiftUI Preview tools.
    - _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md`. Adherence to Material 3 (Android) and HIG (iOS) is key.)_

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    - Not applicable.

- **Data Structures:**
    - Not applicable.

- **Environment Variables:**
    - Not applicable.

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
    - Focus on consistency. If a specific style (e.g., button type, dialog presentation) is used in one place, it should ideally be used for similar interactions elsewhere.
    - Test on different device screen sizes and densities.
    - Small visual tweaks can have a large impact on perceived quality.
    - _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for general UI guidelines.)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Create a checklist of UI areas to review:
    - Main app screen (Android/iOS)
    - Settings screen (Android/iOS)
    - Onboarding flows (Android/iOS)
    - Android Floating Bubble (all states: idle, input, loading, result, error)
    - iOS Action Extension UI (input, loading, result, error)
    - iOS Share Extension UI (input, loading, result, error)
    - All dialogs, error messages, toasts/snackbars.
- [ ] Task 2: Systematically go through each UI area on Android.
    - Check for items listed in "Detailed Requirements" (terminology, fonts, colors, layout, typos, interactions).
    - Document identified issues/polish items.
- [ ] Task 3: Systematically go through each UI area on iOS.
    - Perform checks similar to Task 2.
    - Document identified issues/polish items.
- [ ] Task 4: Prioritize the documented list of polish items.
- [ ] Task 5: Implement fixes for at least 10 high-impact or easy-to-fix minor UI/UX issues (or all if less than 10 found). This might involve:
    - Adjusting padding/margins.
    - Correcting typos.
    - Standardizing button styles or text.
    - Improving alignment.
    - Ensuring consistent iconography.
- [ ] Task 6: Retest the reviewed/modified UI areas to confirm fixes and ensure no regressions.
- [ ] Task 7: Document the review process and the list of addressed items (fulfills AC1 if <10 major items found but thorough review done).

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.
- **Unit Tests:** Not applicable for this type of visual/UX review.
- **Integration Tests:** Not for MVP.
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    - AC1: This is met by the process of review and implementing fixes. A list of >10 changes or a report of the thorough review should be available.
    - AC2: Subjective assessment after polish. The app should feel more cohesive and refined. Compare before/after if possible for some items.
    - AC3: Verify by proofreading all UI text again after changes.
- _(Hint: This story is heavily reliant on keen observation and manual testing across the entire app.)_
